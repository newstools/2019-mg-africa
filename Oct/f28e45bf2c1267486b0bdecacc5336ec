On Wednesday, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni presents the medium-term budget policy speech in Parliament. Since the presentation of the 2018 budget, the country has experienced a technical recession. Exorbitant debt levels, repeated tax revenue shortfall, slowing economic growth and broken state-owned enterprises mean that there is little room for creativity in public finances. Mboweni’s medium-term budget policy statement will likely make crisis management a focal point. Please note that this livestream will go live at 2pm.
