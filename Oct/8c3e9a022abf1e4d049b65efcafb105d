John Steenhuisen said, “The chief-whip is appointed by the leader. Since Mmusi Maimane has announced his resignation from the party and from parliament, my term ends.” In the meantime, deputy chief-whip Jacques Julius will be acting chief-whip, and Steenhuisen is expected to compete for the position of party leader in parliament now vacated by Maimane.
