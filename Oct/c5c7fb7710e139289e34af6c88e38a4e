For me, a writer is something that I hold in high regard. I mean, I read people like Oscar Wilde. For me that person was a genius, and I didn’t think of myself in that way. I thought of it as an aspiration that would never become something real.
Through my schooling years, I loved English. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>I loved all my English teachers. My first English teacher was my Mmemme (my granny). “Rigmarole” — that’s her word. She always used to use bombastic English words and I would be intrigued by them and want to know what the hell she was saying. She used to keep us back during school holidays, because she used to run a crèche when she lived in Matatiele. She was a teacher, and I guess she was idle and bored, so she took it out on us during school holidays. We’d have to come in for lessons. Even back then I used to think of her as quite mentally colonised — for this respect of the English language. But I have to admit I now have the same thing, not necessarily the English language — English is just the language I have more access to. But it’s the thing that shows me that I love language and I love words and how words can be strung together. I love how words can have new meaning. I love creating new words. I love seeing the inconsistencies in the English language. I love to play with language. And I think, looking back, I knew I was going to be a writer. — Nonzi Bogatsu, as told to Franny Rabkin
