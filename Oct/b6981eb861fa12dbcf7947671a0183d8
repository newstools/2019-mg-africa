Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær is “100% sure” that the club has the right structure in place and says money is available to strengthen his struggling squad. United are 12th in the English Premier League table, just two points above the relegation zone and 15 adrift of league leaders Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s clash with their fierce rivals at Old Trafford. The club’s hierarchy and recruitment under executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has come in for severe criticism but Solskjær has described that as “an insult” as he looks to the future. “I’ve got a three-year contract now, so of course [we are] planning long-term,” Solskjær told Sky Sports. “If you lose a game or two, you don’t wait for a call to be given assurances but we have started out a plan and a recruitment plan is in place. “I am 100% sure from my time here that the structure is right because it’s always the manager who has the final say. “I know people have said stuff about our recruitment but it’s almost like an insult to the recruitment office, the scouts and us as professionals — me and [assistant manager] Mick [Phelan], the staff.
We make decisions on the players that we want to have and who’s available and then it’s the negotiations.” United spent £145-million in the English summer on Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James, but Solskjær said more funds were available for the right “ready-made” players. “The money is there and I’ve been looking at players,” Solskjær added. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>“We were close to a couple of players but they weren’t right. “The money is there to strengthen in January, in the summer, and we are planning. We are looking, we are finding our targets. But just before the transfer window ended, no, they weren’t there.” The United manager admitted that misfiring forward Marcus Rashford, who has scored just three goals for the team this season, needed a break but injuries to other players had prevented that. “Marcus’s movement is great, but maybe we just need to give him a game or two of rest because he’s played a lot,” said the Norwegian. “He’s a young boy with lots of expectations on his shoulders, he’s played four or five seasons now, and yet he’s still not even 22 yet.” And he admitted United faced a daunting task in trying to slow Liverpool’s charge towards their first top-flight title since 1990. “There’s a lot of pieces in that puzzle that have to be in place,” he said. “We’ve got to be ready and I think the players are mentally prepared for this one.” I can’t see Liverpool coming to park the bus — that’s just not in their mentality,” Solskjær added. “So I can see it being an open game, which will suit us.” — AFP
