Former Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has resigned as a member of parliament, as well as a member of the party. In a tweet, Maimane said: “I have worked tirelessly to build the project of One SA for All. It’s been my greatest honour to serve the people of SA and will continue to do so.
I have today resigned from the DA and Parliament. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>Thank you to the people of this country for your faith in our nation. God bless SA.”  On Wednesday, Maimane resigned as leader of the official opposition, but said that he would continue as its parliamentary leader. That announcement left the party’s parliamentary caucus divided, with some members saying that he would then be a lame duck leader, with no authority to whip caucus members. “People are unhappy,” said one MP, who was attending the party’s regular Thursday caucus meeting. The party has not officially commented on his resignation, but a DA insider confirmed that he will no longer be a member of the legislature. “There are still administrative issues to iron out. But Mmusi will no longer be caucusing with us,” the senior DA Parliamentary member said. The party must now decide who will lead it from its national headquarters in Johannesburg, and whether the same person, if they are an MP, will also lead the caucus in Parliament. Meanwhile, DA parliamentary Chief Whip John Steenhuisen has also confirmed he’s resigned from his position. “Confirmed Correct. The chief-whip is appointed by the leader. Since Mmusi Maimane has announced his resignation from the party and from parliament, my term ends,” Steenhuisen said In the meantime, deputy chief-whip Jacques Julius will be acting chief-whip.
