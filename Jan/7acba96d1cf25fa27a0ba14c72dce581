In 2018, civil society observed a rise in civic activism, a spirited effort by ordinary citizens that challenged the status quo in many ways, demanding better services from government at all levels of governance as well as holding it accountable for its actions and decisions. As result, the nation saw numerous Cabinet reshuffles and resignations, the establishment of commissions of enquiry, as well as a scrutiny of government promises and decisions on politically sensitive issues such as the land question. This year is a critical one for the country; there are expectations for the government to deliver on last year’s promises concerning job creation and the promotion of good governance in the public sector, including municipalities and state-owned enterprises. Civil society expects speedy implementation of policy decisions that were promised last year, especially with regard to the Public Audit Amendment Bill 2018, which gave the auditor general Kimi Makwetu authority to act against public officials implicated in the misappropriation of government resources. In his report, Makwetu noted that government’s irregular expenditure had reached R50-billion, five times more than the total in 2017. The nation has hailed the Bill as an extraordinary step towards fighting corruption, and its implementation may turn the tide of state misappropriation of finances, providing a glimmer of hope. The media played a significant role of enlightening South Africa’s citizens on several such issues.
It is prudent to expect the media to sustain its citizen education project with responsible and ethical journalism. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>The media and civil society present an active advocacy effort to ensure not only that citizens remain informed of the state of affairs in the country, but also that they are empowered with factual information to be able to execute their civic responsibilities. Their collaborative efforts are needed, especially as national and provincial elections will be held in 2019;  citizens need to be politically aware so that they can make informed choices at the ballots. Civil society will continue in its role of mobilising, activating and educating citizens before they participate in the upcoming elections. This mammoth task requires partnerships with government, its agencies, political parties, the independent electoral commission, labour unions, the private sector, citizen interest groups and religious formations. Citizens must be empowered to participate in the elections with confidence, so that they can freely exercise their choice. Civic and voter education is essential in deepening democracy in the country. Citizens have a civic responsibility, as articulated in chapter 15 of the National Development Plan (NDP), which summarises their responsibilities as follows: All these civic responsibilities are critical to promote national unity and enhance our collective efforts of keeping government in check. This year promises renewal as citizens take up their rightful, vigilant place in society and work together towards safeguarding our hard-won democracy. Our power is in our vote, so let’s do the right thing – register and vote. Your vote carries our hopes and aspirations; it has the power to redeem us from any sense of hopelessness. It’s in your hands as a citizen! Paul Kariuki is executive director at the Democracy Development Programme in Durban. These are his own views
