Every year, the heads of state and governments of the African Union (AU) decide upon a theme which focuses on a key issue facing the continent, and which constitutes a focal area upon which the key activities and messages of the AU will be anchored. In 2019 the annual theme of the AU will be “The year of refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons: towards durable solutions to forced displacement in Africa”. The 2019 AU theme is driven by the need for greater commitment by Africa to address the plight of its citizens in forced migration situations, by implementing strategic and relevant programmes and working towards the ratification of the various AU treaties and legal instruments addressing the plight of refugees and displaced persons to ensure we achieve the goal of Aspiration 4 of Agenda 2063: to provide a peaceful and secure environment for all Africans on the continent. Various AU treaties governing issues related to refugees, human rights, governance and promoting peace on the continent include the OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, OAU Convention for the Elimination of Mercenaries in Africa and the OAU Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance.
