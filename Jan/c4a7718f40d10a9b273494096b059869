The final nail seemed to knocked in on Sunday as Shakes Mashaba and lowly Witbank Spurs knocked the Team of Choice out of the Nedbank Cup. 5 - Muhsin Ertugral lasted for 5 games as manager at #absaprem side Maritzburg United, his shortest ever spell as a manager in the country. Fugitive. — OptaJabu (@OptaJabu) January 28, 2019 “The coach admitted that he was concerned himself and felt he had done everything as best he could to turn things around, but the results did not come,” chairman Farook Kadodia said. “It was then decided that we both shake hands and, by mutual agreement, go our separate ways. “The club had to look at its survival and its future, so it was a ultimately a results based decision.” Maritzburg will likely look to appoint a third coach of the season as soon as the drop draws nearer and nearer.
