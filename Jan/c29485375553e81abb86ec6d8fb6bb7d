Following a cryptic tweet over the weekend where he invited media to a press conference to announce his new political home, former Cabinet spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi declared on Wednesday that he had joined the African Transformation Movement (ATM), a political party formed by Vuyolwethu Zungula and several church leaders. During the press conference, Manyi said the ANC as the party was “sabotaging” itself and cited this as one of the reasons for his departure. This self-sabotage according to Manyi, was in reference to the party’s decision and seeming unwillingness, to implement land expropriation without compensation.
Manyi also criticised the ANC on its inability to tackle issues of transformation. Manyi said he was joining ATM as an individual and not because he is a member of the Bantu Church of Christ. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>He added that the church is not a part of the political party. ATM was formed in 2018 by the South African Council of Messianic Churches in Christ (SACMCC). It promises to “put SA first” and “to transform South Africa into a peaceful, ethically-governed and economically viable state”. Manyi is not the only high-profile ANC member to leave the party in recent months. Former SABC boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng announced the formation of his own party in December 2018. Motsoeneng says African Content Movement (ACM) will focus on poverty, land, unemployment and education by empowering people. The party’s motto is “the future is in your hands”.
