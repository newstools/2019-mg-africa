Orlando Pirates stretched their unbeaten run in the Absa Premiership to 13 games after coming out on top against Chippa United in a six-goal thriller at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday evening. In a match filled with plenty of drama and goals, Pirates claimed the lead after just three minutes, Happy Jele heading home from Thembinkosi Lorch’s in-swinging free-kick. Pule had a great chance to double Bucs’ lead in the 13th minute, but his driven shot from outside the box was saved well by Daniel Akpeyi in the Chippa United goal. Chippa went on to level the scores on 22 minutes as Tlolane pounced on a failed clearance by Jele before firing through the keepers legs at the near post. Pirates were quick to reclaim the lead, though, with Maphanga unlucky to head into his own after Akpeyi had slipped at a crucial moment. The own goal halted the momentum of the visitors as Pirates saw out the remainder of the half with relative ease. And, there were more goals to come after the half-time break as the slippery conditions made it hard for the players to control the ball. Pirates stretched further ahead in the 56th minute, Pule converting from the penalty spot after Gaona Modisane has brought him down in the danger area. However, Chippa refused to let their heads drop and their hard graft eventually led to a huge slice of luck as a ball in from a corner was flicked on before taking a deflection off Maela and crossing the line. They continued to press and very nearly made it 3-3 soon afterwards as Rhulani Manzini struck the post with an effort from way outside. And, the Chilli Boys were made to rue that missed chance, Pirates substitute Mahachi popped up in the 86th minute to fire home from Asavela Mbekile’s cross, making 4-2 to the hosts. The result sees Milutin Sredojevic’s side move to within two points of table-topping Bidvest Wits, while Chippa remain just one point clear of bottom-of-the-table Maritzburg United. — Sport 24
