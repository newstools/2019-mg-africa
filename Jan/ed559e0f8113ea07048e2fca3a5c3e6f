On Thursday, Duduzane Zuma — flanked by his father, former president Jacob Zuma — appeared in the Randburg magistrate’s court in Johannesburg where his case was postponed to March 26. Zuma faces three charges: two counts of culpable homicide and one of negligent driving. The charges relate to a car accident in February 2014 where Zuma lost control of his Porsche and rear-ended a taxi on the Grayston Drive off-ramp on the M1, north of Johannesburg’s city centre. Phumzile Dube, a mother to a two-year-old, was killed instantly while three others were injured. The family received R5 000 from the taxi association but no compensation was paid from the Road Accident Fund. Jeanette Mashaba, a second passenger, died a few weeks later.
An inquest later found that her death was not caused by the accident. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>She died in hospital from natural causes. Zuma indicated to the magistrate that he understood the instructions handed down, and he would be available on the court date. His smiling father sat in the public gallery, observing proceedings. When court adjourned, Zuma left to make a second appearance — this time at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in the city centre. He is appearing on charges related to an alleged bribe the Gupta brothers attempted to make to former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas. Duduzane is accused of facilitating and attending the meeting where the alleged bribe was offered. The National Prosecuting Authority provisionally dropped the charges on the basis that Jonas’ evidence, which was presented before the state capture inquiry, has not been “finalised”.
