The inquiry into the fitness for office of suspended deputy head of prosecutions Nomgcobo Jiba began with a bang on Monday after the Sunday Times reported that former Bosasa chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi would tell the Zondo inquiry into state capture that Jiba had been on Bosasa’s monthly bribe payroll. In the article Jiba denied receiving bribes, a denial that was repeated by her counsel Thabani Masuku SC when the Mokgoro inquiry got under way. He said the media reports were prejudicial to Jiba. The inquiry, chaired by former Constitutional Court judge Yvonne Mokgoro, was established by President Cyril Ramaphosa to look into whether Jiba and head of the National Prosecuting Authority’s specialised commercial crime unit Lawrence Mrwebi were fit for office after the two had been roundly criticised in a number of court judgments in high-profile and politically sensitive court cases.
