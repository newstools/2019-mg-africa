Attempts have been made to coerce former chief operations officer of the controversial Bosasa group Angelo Agrizzi into silence, through bribes and threats on his life, the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture heard on Wednesday. The commission, chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, kicked off its first session of 2019 with evidence from Agrizzi — whose testimony has been kept under wraps in the lead-up to the hearing. According to Paul Pretorius SC, the head of the commission’s legal team, the evidence of a credible threat to Agrizzi’s life meant that the team chose not to send notices to parties implicated by Agrizzi. An affidavit from the commission’s investigators suggests that 38 people are implicated in Agrizzi’s evidence. Agrizzi will give evidence of attempts to bribe people at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in an effort to prevent prosecutions at Bosasa, Pretorius explained. Pretorius told the commission that Agrizzi’s statement will include audio recordings, video and photographic evidence, including photographs he took of a confidential NPA file on Bosasa.
Agrizzi was allegedly shown this file at the Sheraton Hotel in Pretoria in 2015. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>The file was purpotedly handed to Agrizzi and then Bosasa chief executive Gavin Watson by former SAA board chair Dudu Myeni. The commission’s investigators have confirmed the carpet pattern in the photographs matches that of the hotel, Pretorius revealed. Video evidence will also be presented at the commission, allegedly showing Watson counting bribe money for state officials, including former Correctional Services chief financial officer Patrick Gillingham. Gillingham was allegedly paid R110 000 a month by Watson. Bosasa, which has secured contracts from the department of correctional services worth billions of rands, first became involved in South African prisons in 2004 when it won a tender to provide catering services. In late 2006, the Public Service Commission and the office of the auditor general referred specific allegations relating to improper behaviour with regard to contracts awarded to Bosasa to the Special Investigating Unit (SIU). The unit’s investigation, which began in 2007, focused on tenders for the supply of catering, fencing, security services and televisions. Bosasa later sought to interdict the unit from continuing its investigation. Most recently, President Cyril Ramaphosa has been linked to Bosasa after his 2017 campaign for the ANC presidency received a payment of R500 000 by Watson. Though the president later told the National Assembly in November last year that the payment was a donation, he previously said the payment was made as part of a contract with his son, Andile. Pretorius recounted the many threats Agrizzi has allegedly received in the wake of his testimony. Agrizzi reported these threats to the Hawks in December 2018. One of these threats came from a Bosasa chairperson, identified by Pretorius as “Gumede”, who allegedly threatened to order a hit on Agrizzi. Agrizzi also allegedly received numerous anonymous phone calls threatening him with harm or death in the lead-up to his testimony. The commission’s legal team submitted that it is in the interest of the public to protect the evidence of Agrizzi so that persons in a similar position feel it is safe to come forward. The hearing continues.
