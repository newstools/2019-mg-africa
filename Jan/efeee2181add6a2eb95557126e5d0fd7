Workers’ rights lawyer Jay Surju, who was born on August 25 1962, died on January 15. He represented major trade unions in landmark cases against multinational corporations, provided free counsel in student struggles at universities and at schools, and challenged injustice from the 1980s until his death. He was widely consulted on legal matters in local and international media and was in private practice at the time of his death. Surju was a complex and prickly human being with a rough demeanour, but his friends knew him as a generous and gentle soul, a trustworthy friend and comrade.
