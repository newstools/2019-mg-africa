He told the commission of inquiry that he personally paid former prison boss Patrick Gillingham. He testified that Gillingham used to receive R47 000 per month from Bosasa while he was still employed by the department of correctional services. However, when he left, Bosasa paid him R110 000. It was reported previously that Bosasa allegedly bribed Gillingham, who was the department’s chief financial officer, and prison boss Linda Mti to secure four tenders between 2004 and 2007, worth roughly R1.5-billion, including the supply of televisions and fencing at prisons around the country, the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) found. A statement written by former Bosasa auditor, Peet Venter, which was read out by evidence leader Paul Pretorius, revealed details of bribes to Gillingham. “Mark Taverner, Gavin Watson’s brother in law, retains Patrick Gillingham on the payroll of BEE foods at a salary of R65 000 a month and a company car, Mercedes GLA 200 over and above his R110 000 a month cash bribe,” according to the statement. Pretorius asked Agrizzi: “During the period of his employment at correctional services, was Patrick Gillingham paid by Bosasa?” “Yes, he was,” Agrizzi answered. Agrizzi is expected to continue with his testimony on Monday. — News24
