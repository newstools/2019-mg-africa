Consumers put the brakes on festive season spending, hurting JSE-listed heavyweights such as Mr Price, Woolworths and Massmart, whose results sparked a big sell-off in their shares. Massmart, which includes Game, Makro, Wired and Dion, saw its share price fall by 21% on Tuesday after reporting flat sales.

Its overall turnover, held back largely by its non-South African operations, grew by only 0.03% over the past six-month reporting period. “The economy is struggling and consumers up until November were facing the highest petrol price in the country’s history,” said independent retail analyst Syd Vianello.
