Woolworths has apologised to Cape Town business owner Shannon McLaughlin, who accused the big retailer of stealing her baby carrier design. McLaughlin, the founder of Ubuntu Baba, is the most recent of several people who have accused Woolworths of appropriating their products. On Monday, she posted in a blog about how, in December, she was alerted to an alleged rip-off of her product by Woolworths. She pointed out the similarities between her baby carrier and the one sold by the retailer.

Following the “chat” on Wednesday, Woolworths released a statement saying it had concluded its investigations and would remove the product from its online and physical stores.
