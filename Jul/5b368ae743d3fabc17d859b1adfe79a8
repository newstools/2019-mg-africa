I’ve wanted to be known as the best publicist of all time for at least the last seven years — going back to when I was 19. I enjoy getting the word out and influencing creative conversations.
When I worked with record label Ambitiouz Entertainment, as a public relations liaison, I was introduced to artists like Sjava, A-Reece, Amanda Black and Emtee. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>Little did I know that these people were becoming stars because of me; I helped build them. Then I started getting a lot of requests to represent artists and brands. I rejected them because I didn’t think I could do that on my own. I was scared of doing my own thing. I mean, how would I start my own business? How would I pay my bills? Would I be able to pay for my car? That kept me at Ambitiouz. But then Sibu Mabena got in touch with me. She runs a communications agency that manages musicians, influencers and writers. For some reason she wanted to collaborate with me. The project needed my undivided attention for 24-hours a day, but I couldn’t do that while working for my previous employer. That was my green light. I had to leave Ambitiouz to pursue this. I needed that push. So far so good. It hasn’t been more than two months but my clientele already includes Yfm, Nomuzi Mabena, Patoranking, K.O, Shekinah, and Gemini Major. — Public relations specialist Kgadi Mothotse (26)
