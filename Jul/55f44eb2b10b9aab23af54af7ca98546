The minister of mineral resources and energy, Gwede Mantashe, has announced that his department will not be extracting gas by way of fracking, but it will use “other methodologies” after a court ruled in favour of anti-fracking groups. “The recent judgment prohibiting us from fracking is interpreted wrongly as saying there must [be] nothing happening — [but] we can access that gas if we use methodologies other than fracking, and that is what we are going to be focusing on,” Mantashe said. The minister did not, however, mention what other techniques may be used. His remarks were made at the tabling of the department’s 2019-2020 budget vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
