Chelsea confirmed on Thursday morning that club legend Frank Lampard has been appointed head coach. The news comes as little surprise as the move has looked all but confirmed for close to a month. The former midfielder replaces Maurizio Sarri at the Blues.
Despite leading them to a third-place finish and Europa League title, the Italian failed to ingratiate himself with much of the fanbase and little fuss was made when he decided to join Juventus last month. After retiring from football in 2016, Lampard was given the opportunity to cut his teeth in management at Derby County last year. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>He repaid the faith in his inexperience and took the club to the Championship playoff final. Lampard’s immediate goal at Chelsea will be to steer them safely through what will be a trying time of transition. Having already fallen below Manchester City and Liverpool in the English hierarchy, the route back to the top is blocked by a two-season transfer ban and concerns over ownership stability. With star player Eden Hazard also lost to Real Madrid, expect Lampard to rely on youth prospects with unprecedented regularity. To most fans, the announcement will be a welcome slice of good news. Arguably the greatest player to ever wear a blue shirt, he is revered like few others at the club. With 211 goals, he is the highest goalscorer in the club’s history and also the most prolific midfielder the Premier League has ever seen.
