New regulations due to come into effect on December 15 this year, which will prohibit the use of part of the radio spectrum above the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in the Northern Cape, have the airline industry asking what this will mean for the country’s and the continent’s busiest air route. Aviation is excluded from these regulations for now, but the industry is concerned about the lack of clarity about its operations after December. There are even concerns that aircraft may be expected to skirt the area, perhaps adding as much an hour to the flight between Johannesburg and Cape Town. The route has about 55 domestic passenger flights a day, and is also used by international airlines flying between Cape Town and the Gulf. The SKA, which will contain thousands of antennaes, is located near Carnarvon. This article is only available to Mail & Guardian subscribers at present. Please login or consider subscribing.
