On Sunday, President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation and answer questions from the media about the Public Protector advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebaneâ€™s damning report into a R500 000 donation to his ANC presidential campaign from Gavin Watson, the controversial head of Bosasa. The move is likely meant to illustrate two things: that the president takes the findings of the public protector seriously and an attempt to limit the political damage the report has inflicted on his presidency.
