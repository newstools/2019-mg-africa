by Anne Mager and Phiko Jeffrey Velelo (UCT Press, Juta and Co ) As one drives through Cradock, in the Eastern Cape, past Whittlesea, Cofimvaba, Cathcart and Tsomo down to the Great Kei River, signposts at the threshold of dusty tracks lead into the rural hinterland of the former Transkei and into the past.
