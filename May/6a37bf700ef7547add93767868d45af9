The much anticipated Cabinet announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa saw a return to inclusive governance with a nod to unions, business and even the opposition. Gender parity and youth representation were also key components in the national executive, a trend seen throughout the provinces by both the governing ANC and opposition office bearers. Seemingly breaking from tradition, the new Cabinet followed an exhaustive consultation process which has been described as “unlike any other” held by an ANC president. The Cabinet includes unionists like new Minister of Trade and Industry and Economic Development Ebrahim Patel, deputy minister of agriculture, land reform and rural development Sdumo Dlamini and Thulas Nxesi, who has the unenviable task of addressing the country’s unemployment crisis as minister of employment and labour. Returning to the executive is defence minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, who in 2016 allegedly smuggled a Burundian woman into South Africa on a state-owned jet. “For the first time in the history of our country, half of all ministers are women.
We have also included a significant number of young people. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>This is in fulfilment of our commitment to giving young people roles of responsibility in all sectors of society,” Ramaphosa explained.
