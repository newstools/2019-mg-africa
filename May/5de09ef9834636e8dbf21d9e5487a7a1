Dear President Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa: We write to you as youth collectively concerned about the future of our world, particularly the ocean, air and environment all living things rely upon. We are just a few out of the millions of youthful South Africans who are conscious of the state we live in.
Inspired by the sentiment of heroes past, we aspire to play a role in building a better future for our country. To this end, Mr President, we seek to bring to your attention a host of environmental issues as well as the dangerous move conducted by Mining Minister Gwede Mantashe last year in December, when he lifted the moratorium on offshore hydrocarbon exploration. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>Ill-advisedly and unwittingly, Mr Mantashe and the larger South African governing body are betraying the social compact between the government and those of us who are young, as well as those yet to be born. South Africa is one of the most unequal societies in the world. This inequality emerges strongly in the face of inescapable natural disasters and adverse weather events brought about by a changing climate, as evidenced by what has befallen us here in KwaZulu-Natal and in Mozambique. One does not have to look very far back to recall the devastation brought about by the drought in the Western Cape, the severe sea storms off KwaZulu-Natal in 2017 and the now annual assault of wildfires that affect the Garden Route. The effects of climate change are felt most by those who have caused the least harm — the poor — ultimately costing the government and relief organisations dearly. It therefore makes little economic sense to invest in industries that exacerbate climate change, as immense externalised costs eventually emerge down the value chain. The United Nations, in fact, stipulated that $2.2-trillion worth of fossil fuel projects are at risk of being stranded — that is, being left valueless as the market for fossil fuels shrinks. Concrete, peer reviewed, globally accepted evidence supports the influence of climate change on weather, and our people are not prepared for it. Specific to South Africa, research shows that climate change is moving economically viable fish stocks – such as anchovy, round herring and sardines – in an eastward direction. There is a southward movement of spotted grunter, among other fish, an increase in the occurrence of algal blooms, which is detrimental to West Coast rock lobsters, and an overall increase in dangerous wind conditions in the Southern Cape. These effects do not occur in isolation. Profitable and sustainable industries such as tourism, fishing, hospitality and agriculture are compromised because of the harmful effects of climate change. South Africa once had to take unpopular but necessary decisions to address malignant, institutionalised racism. It can be argued that this situation is not altogether dissimilar. For a long time, the petroleum, coal and other fossil fuel industries have perpetuated this inequality by denying or diminishing the extent of climate change, subsequently trivialising the environmental and socioeconomic insecurity faced by so many. But, dear president, this is not news to you. As the country’s first citizen, you are privy to the geopolitical utterances made at high-level congregations such as the G20, G7 and Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) summits you are obligated to attend. Climate change being a persistent issue at these gatherings must surely warrant the same decisive action we took against racism. Sadly, our very own government ministries, such as the departments of mineral resources, energy and environmental affairs, through the goggles of sunset industry development, are creating an enabling environment for adverse climate effects. These are not just limited to those to be born in the future — many vulnerable and unprepared South Africans are already experiencing the dreadful repercussions of a fossil fuel-reliant global economy today, via the effect of accelerated climate change. Honourable president, we would like to raise a few salient points of order to make our case: The climate issue is no longer one of rich versus poor, black versus white, the haves versus the have-nots. It transcends all societal boundaries; we will all surely suffer. Please take decisive action on fossil fuels, Mr President.
