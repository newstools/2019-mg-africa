No arrests have been made as yet. eNCA reported that KZN ANCYL provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo expressed his anger at what he calls a “politically motivated” killing. He told the broadcaster that the killings, according to the ANCYL, “have political connotations”. At the same time, youth league leader in the province told iOL that Moyo’s death was a"big loss”. “We know the contribution made by this young man to the emancipation of the community in general and the youth in particular. In March, the ANCYL in KZN bemoaned the fact that the youth had been the “biggest casualty in political killings”. “The youth in this province has been the biggest casualty in these senseless killings of political activists. We, therefore, call for the full might of the law to be meted against anyone who is involved in these senseless killings no matter their standing in society,” the league said at the time. — News24
