A University of Cape Town professor has become the first African to be awarded one of the world’s most prestigious archaeology prizes for the second time. Shadreck Chirikure won the Antiquity journal’s 2019 Antiquity prize for his paper titled Elites and Commoners at Great Zimbabwe: Archaeological and Ethnographic Insights on Social Power. The paper challenged the idea that the site was divided between elites and commoners, instead concluding that people mixed much more freely than had been thought. It also concluded that “class was very fluid” among people who lived around Great Zimbabwe. Chirikure, who heads the university’s archaeology department and is director of the Archaeological Materials Laboratory, said his win proves that the work done by African researchers about Africa is relevant and can compete on the world stage.
