The Bookshop is an adaptation of Penelope Fitzgerald’s novel of that name, originally published in 1978 but looking back to an era more than 20 years earlier — that of post-war Britain, with the consciousness of austerity and sense of social stratification that that evokes. It is set in the 1950s, and, apart from the sets and the costumes and so on, we know this because a key plot point has to do with Vladimir Nabokov’s controversial novel Lolita, which came out in Britain in 1955. The story concerns a young widow, Florence Green (Emily Mortimer), who moves to a small seaside town and there, in a rackety old building, opens a bookshop.
