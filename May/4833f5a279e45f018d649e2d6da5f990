The presidential inauguration will cost over R100-million less than former president Jacob Zuma’s inauguration in 2014. Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma briefed journalists on the inauguration scheduled to take place at Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria on May 25. The inauguration will see president-elect Cyril Ramaphosa sworn in as the leader of the country by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. Dlamini-Zuma said the move to shift the inauguration from the Union Buildings to the stadium was a cost-cutting measure in addition to making the event more accessible to ordinary South Africans. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> The tight budget has also resulted in a limited number of heads of state attending the event, with invites sent to presidents from Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries as well as presidents chairing forums such as the African Union. Some 32 000 people were expected at the stadium. Dlamini-Zuma said she could not say exactly what the cost of the event would be until after the inauguration. However, she said the cost would be over R100-million less than the R240-million government shelled out on the last inauguration. “It will be 100-million less… but it won’t be more than R120-million. Last time it was R240-million. Until you have the event you can’t tell how much it will cost to the cent,” Dlamini-Zuma said. She said the government was aware of the economic difficulties facing the country, but still felt it was important for the “nation to be part of the President coming into office”.
