Duduzane Zuma, the son of former president Jacob Zuma, will appear in the Randburg magistrates court on Thursday to continue with a case against him where he faces charges of culpable homicide. He appeared in court on Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty and began his testimony, but the case was halted by a technical difficulty pushing the state to postpone proceedings until Thursday. Zuma has been charged with two counts of culpable homicide and one of negligent driving after he crashed his Porsche into a taxi in 2014. One woman was killed and three others were injured. Phumzile Dube died at the scene and her family received R5 000 from a taxi association, but no compensation from the Road Accident Fund. Another passenger, Jeanette Mashaba, died a few weeks after the crash.
However, an inquest by the state found that her death was not caused by the crash.
