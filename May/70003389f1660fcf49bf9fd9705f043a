Peter Marais, Freedom Front Plus’ (FF+) candidate for Western Cape Premier, says he wants to be deployed to the National Assembly to go toe-to-toe with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Democratic Alliance (DA). The FF+ won just 1.57% of the vote in the Western Cape and should be allocated at least one seat in the provincial legislature. But the 70-year-old career politician says his talents would be wasted in the backbenches of the legislature. “I would love to cross swords with the EFF.
I would love to cross swords with the DA at that level. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>I’ve had many years on provincial and local level. And that would be the cherry on top to spar with the Economic Freedom Fighters, and with the ANC. What a battle that would be!” he said after the final results in the Western Cape were announced. From 2000 to 2001, Marais was mayor of Cape Town Mayor between 2000 and 2001. The year after that, he went on to serve as Western Cape premier. The FF+ has seen big gains in the 2019 polls. It is set to become the fifth largest political party in the National Assembly with 2.3% of the vote. The party’s leadership estimates it will be allocated between eight and 12 seats in Parliament. Marais said he is ready to take a seat on the national stage if asked to do so by his party. Another veteran politician could also make her return to national politics is former Cape Town mayor and DA member, Patricia de Lille. De Lille also campaigned for the Premiership in the province. Her party — GOOD — secured 3% of the vote in the provincial poll. But Brett Herron,  the party’s secretary general, said with more than 66 000 votes nationally, GOOD is expected to be allocated one seat in the National Assembly. “I think it’s likely she will go to national, and then I will be in the provincial legislature,” Herron said.
