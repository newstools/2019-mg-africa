The makeup of cabinet is expected to be announced next week The ANC’s Secretary General, Ace Magashule, said there’s no decision yet on who will take the Speaker’s chair. With discussion primarily focused on election results. “Today we are just analysing and getting a report on the elections. How we performed, seeing our strengths, our opportunities, our weaknesses. And the president also presented his overview on how we performed,” Magashule said. He said discussions on the possible composition of Ramaphosa’s government are still ongoing. “We will discuss the reconfiguration of government. The president will brief us and update us. But we won’t have time today. We will discuss as we move on. It is the beginning of that work.” Magashule went on to say: “It’s a wonderful meeting, frank and open. And we are saying this is the time we go out and implement our election manifesto… The spirit and the mood of the meeting is very encouraging, going back to unity and renewal.” The ANC has said that it goes into the sixth democratic Parliament with a renewed focus for service delivery. This despite it being a caucus still seemingly divided along factional lines.
