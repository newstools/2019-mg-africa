Maurencia Gillion, the treasurer of the ANC in the Western Cape, has been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation into a election donation by businessperson Iqbal Survé. The ANC confirmed that the matter was discussed at a provincial working committee (PWC) meeting to finalise deployments to the Western Cape legislature and to discuss the campaign’s finances. ANC provincial executive committee spokesperson Lionel Adendorf confirmed Gillion’s suspension. “We received a report on the election finances and based on that there was also the issue of the donation of Dr Iqbal Survé and then the PWC decided to launch and official investigation and pending the outcome of that investigation decided to suspend the provincial treasurer,” Adendorf said. Days before last week’s election, the party in the province received a R1-million donation from Survé for food and supplies for party agents and volunteers on election day. The party’s leadership ordered that the money be returned. But, according to Adendorf, it never was. “We gave an instruction that the money be repaid last week, and today we were informed that the money had not been transferred back and that the money has been dispersed despite the explicit instructions that the money be sent back,” he said. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> Adendorf said while an investigation continues, preliminary reports are that Survé was approached by certain members of the party for the donation. “From Dr Survé, he said that it was some officials who approached him for a donation but that will form part of the investigation.” Gillion did not respond to requests for comment.
