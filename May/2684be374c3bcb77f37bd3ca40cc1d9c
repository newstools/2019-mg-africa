Freedom Front Plus (FF+) has climbed up to the top three most searched politics parties in the past 24 hours according to Google search trends. The Mail & Guardian reported on Wednesday that Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane was the most searched for political leader but the FF+ has overtaken Maimaneâ€™s party in trending searches. The other two political parties that are most searched for are the ANC and the Economic Freedom Fighters. According to predictions on Thursday by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in partnership with the SABC, the FF+ could double the votes it won in the 2014 national elections. In 2014, the party won 0.9% of votes with a voter turnout of 73.48% but the CSIR predicts the party could win 2.86% of the vote nationally with a voter turnout of 64.89%. Unlike many of the smaller parties, the FF+ has not been losing votes over the past four elections and although they went from nine to three seats in the 1999 election, the party has since been able to maintain four seats in the National Assembly.
