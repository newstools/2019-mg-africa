President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Cabinet has brought some lesser known politicians to the fore to take up critical positions in portfolios like trade and industry, finance, education and labour. Here’s a snapshot of some of the new and not so familiar faces. Nomalungelo Gina, the new deputy minister of trade and industry, previously served as chair of Parliament’s basic education portfolio committee after being elected to the fifth parliament on the KwaZulu-Natal list for the National Assembly.  Gina is the wife of the late trade unionist and ANC leader Cedric Gina and is deployed to the party’s Melmoth constituency in Zululand. Fikile Majola, the second trade and industry deputy minister, is a former general secretary of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) who was elected to parliament on an ANC ticket in 2009. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>A former treasurer of the United Democratic Front (UDF) Southern Transvaal region, Majola served on parliament’s energy portfolio committee.
