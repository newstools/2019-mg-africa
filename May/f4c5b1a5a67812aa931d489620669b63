Three days before the sixth general elections, hundreds of party faithful streamed into the Ellis Park stadium ahead of the ANC’s final rally on Sunday. The Siyanqoba rally is billed as a show of force in the final push for votes ahead of the most crucial election since 1994. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address supporters in the the 62 000- capacity stadium by 11am. The ANC is facing a strident challenge from opposition parties in the election on May 8 after being emboldened by the governing party’s slide in electoral support to below 60% in the 2016 local government election. While the ANC is expected to retain its majority, electoral trends show it is likely to drop in support from the 62% obtained in 2014. The ANC’s grip on support in the Gauteng province — the country’s economic hub —has dramatically declined in the last national and local election and it is fighting hard to retain it. ANC supporters decked in green and gold steadily streamed into the Ellis Park stadium as entertainers performed on stage on Sunday morning before proceedings kicked off. Supporters were in good spirits, breaking out in song and brandishing ANC flags. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> The Economic Freedom Fighters, the third largest party in the country is expected to grow its support in the upcoming polls. It is holding its final ready in Soweto on Sunday, audaciously competing with the governing party’s in hosting the showpiece rally on the same day. The Democratic Alliance held its final launch on Saturday. The Inkatha Freedom Party also held its final rally in KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. The party is expected to regain support in the province in this election after the departure of former president Jacob Zuma as president last year.
