Former president Jacob Zuma and his co-accused, the French arms company French Arms company Thales are in the Pietermaritzburg high court for the third day of their hearing in a bid to have cases against them quashed. During his opening arguments on Monday May 20, Zuma’s lawyer, advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, told a full bench of the high court that the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) legal pursuit of Zuma constituted a public “lynching” that left his client a “victim of mob justice”.
