The ANC in the Western Cape says the 2019 provincial poll is a platform for the party to retake the City of Cape Town in the 2021 local government elections. With more than two-thirds of voting districts declared in the Western Cape, the incumbent Democratic Alliance (DA) is holding firm to continue governing the province, but with a reduced majority. At the time of an Electoral Commission of South Africa presser at 2pm, the DA held just below 55% of electoral support, with the ANC at just under 30%. Both parties are currently below their 2014 provincial election mark. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are currently the third largest party in the province with 3.4%. GOOD — Patricia de Lille’s offering — is fourth with 2.95%. Though the ANC is unlikely to reign given the strength of the DA in the province, the party says it has a lot to be positive about. “Our campaign strategy was called, ‘Constructing Victory for 2019 Plus’ and it was always said by us this is the foundation for renewal.
We should aim for 50 percent of municipalities [in the Western Cape] in 2021. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>And the province in 2024,” ANC provincial head Ebrahim Rasool said. The party has shown some gains in wards previously held by the DA. In the Bo-Kaap in the Cape Town CBD, the ANC beat the DA to first place, followed by Al Jama-ah in second with the DA coming in at third. Just last week, the area was declared a national heritage site by Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa after concerns by residents that the historic community could fall victim to gentrification. Rasool says the positives have not always resulted in victories. “In Rylands, Gatesville there were VDs that the DA won by very few votes. That is very positive for us. Because from being ANC strongholds, to DA strongholds, and now they are coming back. So our middle class, Muslim areas are coming back to us,” Rasool said. The IEC in the Western Cape says counting has been completed and are currently being audited. The commission’s provincial head — Courtney Sampson — says final provincial results will be announced by noon on Friday.
