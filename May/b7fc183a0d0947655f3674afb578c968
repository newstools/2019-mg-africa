Since 1982, the year in which Billy Monk’s only photo exhibition took place and the year of his death, he has been known as a photographer for a small oeuvre of pictures he produced in the mid-1960s. They show the revellers of a very “alternative” (as it would come to be called) nightlife, sympathetically portrayed, and they are rough-and-ready in some ways, informal and improvised, but also composed with an artist’s eye. Monk had been a small-time crook, was in a “common-law marriage” to a woman of colour, had two children, and worked as a bouncer at the Catacombs, an underground (literally and figuratively) nightclub, if that’s not too posh a word, near the docks of Cape Town.
