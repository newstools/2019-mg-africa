From swapping the orange overalls of a prisoner for the red overalls of the Economic Freedom Fighters, to the National Council of Provinces, Kenny Motsamai says his fight for freedom is not over. The newly sworn-in delegate was only recently released from Boksburg prison and is on parole after serving almost 28 years behind bars. He was convicted in 1989 for the murder of a traffic officer in Rustenburg. At the time he was a commander in the Azanian People’s Liberation Army (Apla), the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress.
