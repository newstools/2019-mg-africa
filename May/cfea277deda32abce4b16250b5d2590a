The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Northern Cape went into this election confident that it could bring the provincial ANC’s support base below 50%. The ANC rubbished that claim. And, with 87.3% of votes counted so far, it appears that the DA might have to think of a better strategy to attract support in that province. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>The ANC is sitting on 57% of the vote, with the DA trailing behind at 21.28% followed by the EFF at just over 10.24%. Ahead of the elections DA provincial leader, Andrew Louw, who was also the province’s premier candidate, said residents of the Northern Cape were tired of empty promises from the ruling party and that the party hoped that if it brings down the support base of the ANC it would form a coalition government. Speaking to the Mail & Guardian earlier this month, Tebogo Obusitse, chairperson of the Sol Plaatje Community Forum and leader of 2018’s Shutdown Kimberley campaign, said the ANC will win in that province because people do not trust other parties. ANC chairperson in Northern Cape, Zamani Saul, was also confident that the party would not lose it’s support base in the province. He also told the M&G early this month that it was “completely impossible” for the DA to take the ANC from 64% to less than 50%. An Ipsos poll conducted in March and April also revealed that the DA would fail in its bid to take the Northern Cape. This predictions seems to have been spot on — at least — in the case of the Northern Cape.
