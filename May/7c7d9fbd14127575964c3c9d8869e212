ANC deputy president David Mabuza will not be sworn in as a member of Parliament on Wednesday. Mabuza has asked for the swearing-in to be postponed so that he can address the allegations against him by the party’s integrity commission. “The National Officials of the African National Congress (ANC) have received and agreed to a request by the ANC Deputy President, Comrade David Mabuza, to postpone his swearing in as a member of Parliament,” said a statement signed off by President Cyril Ramaphosa, issued by the ANC. “The Deputy President made the request in light of a report by the ANC Integrity Commission in which he is alleged to have prejudiced the integrity of the ANC and brought the organisation into disrepute.” He would like to address the integrity commission on these allegations but has also decided to follow his conscience and postpone his swearing in. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>It is unclear when Mabuza will be meeting the integrity commission or when his swearing in has been postponed to. “The Deputy President believes that the ANC as a governing party should advance the electoral mandate in an environment of public trust.” The party commended Mabuza for his stance. Ramaphosa said he personally applauded Mabuza for his resolve in putting the ANC first. ANC integrity commission chairperson George Mashamba said the commission will be meeting Mabuza on Wednesday next week where he will provide an explanation on the allegations levelled against him. Mashamba said the commission will be meeting other ANC leaders who have been flagged as having brought the party into disrepute from Sunday. This may include 22 senior ANC members. Once the commission has met with members, recommendations will be made and presented to the party’s national executive committee. This is a developing story and will be updated as more details emerge.
