The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) announced on Thursday morning that it had placed its general secretary, Dennis George, on precautionary suspension. George had been placed on special leave on February 6. “This decision comes in the wake of allegations relating to the acquisition of shares in technology company, Ayo Technology Systems,” said the federation. “In remaining steadfast to the principles of accountability, and the continued promotion of good, clean, ethical governance, Fedusa initiated an independent, external investigation to determine the veracity of the allegations. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>The investigation remains ongoing.” George previously denied any wrongdoing to media after he was placed on special leave, saying he was only facing “allegations” and had already answered questions put to him by the federation. “I have answered some of the questions I have been asked… they [Fedusa] have a right to conduct the investigation as required by the law. But I must state these are just allegations. They are baseless,” he said on February 6. Ayo Technology Solutions has been under the spotlight at the judicial commission of inquiry into state-run asset manager the Public Investment Corporation (PIC). George is an independent member of the Ayo board. Earlier in the week the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission ordered the PIC to recoup its R4.3-billion investment in the company. — Fin24
