Key witnesses are expected to testify before the Commission of Inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) when it resumes on Monday. The new round of public hearings take place amid death threats against witnesses who have testified before the inquiry and a walk-out by the corporation’s board which quit early this month. “Evidence will be presented by key witnesses. However, the names of the witnesses will be made public when they appear before the Commission to give their evidence,” the commission said in a statement. The commission revealed that witnesses who have testified before the commission have received anonymous death threats.
The inquiry, headed by former president of the Supreme Court of Appeal, Justice Lex Mpati, submitted its interim report to President Cyril Ramaphosa on February 15, but the report has not been made public. The PIC was this month rocked by a sudden resignation of the board, which said there had been a “concerted effort” to discredit its function. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>In their letter of resignation, the nine non-executive board members further stated that there had been “various allegations against at least four directors for now”.
