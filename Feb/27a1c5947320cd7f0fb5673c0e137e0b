Three people including Bosasa’s former chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi appeared briefly in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on Wednesday. Along with Agrizzi were former chief financial officer for the correctional services department Patrick Gillingham and former Bosasa chief financial officer Andries Van Tonder. Prosecutor Peter Serunye said that former commissioner of correctional services Linda Mti — whose name was already on the draft charge sheet — would be added the next day. According to a draft charge sheet, between them they are facing 15 counts of corruption and money laundering under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. Mti does not face any money laundering charges, according to the draft charge sheet. The accused companies are African Global Operations (formerly Bosasa Operations), Sondolo IT and Phezulu Fencing.
Serunye said the state would not oppose bail and recommended an amount of R20 000 on the condition that the accused surrender their passports. Agrizzi’s attorney said he had “handed himself over after he received a call from the investigating officer”. Magistrate Martin Van Wyk granted bail and the case was postponed until March 27 – “for the addition of the further suspects,” said Serunye.
