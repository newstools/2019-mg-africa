Philippine journalist Maria Ressa was freed on bail on Thursday following an arrest that sparked international censure and allegations she is being targeted over her news site’s criticism of President Rodrigo Duterte. Ressa stepped out of a Manila court where she posted bail after spending the night in detention at the National Bureau of Investigation, whose agents arrested her Wednesday on a “cyber libel” charge that carries a penalty of 12 years behind bars. “You are hereby directed to discharge from your custody the person of Maria Angelita Ressa,” the court said in a written order to investigators. © Agence France-Presse
