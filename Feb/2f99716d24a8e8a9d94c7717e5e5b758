A student at Durban University of Technology (DUT) was shot and killed on Tuesday night. According to a statement released by the university, students were protesting outside the university’s Steve Biko campus on Tuesday afternoon. The student, whom the Economic Freedom Fighters say was a member of the party’s student command at the university — was injured during the demonstration and died while receiving medical attention at the City Hospital in Durban. The unnamed student’s family is yet to be notified. During the campus shutdown on Monday, DUT students expressed their frustrations with delays receiving social grants from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) as well as a shortage in available accommodation. The cause of death and the events leading up to the student’s death remain unclear, the university said, adding that a preliminary investigation by police officials is underway. DUT has said that all academic programmes have been suspended until further notice. Last year, Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) law student Katlego Monareng was shot and killed during a protest outside the university’s Soshanguve north campus following the student representative council election. Constables John Slender and Joseph Rapoo were arrested in connection with Monareng’s death in August.
The constables case has been postponed to allow for the National Prosecuting Authority to decide if the case should be transferred to the high court.
