The budget delivered by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni on Wednesday walked a fine line between the battle for tax revenue and the need to minimise any negative effect tax hikes could have on economic growth. So, although the budget did not include any direct increases in major tax categories, it outlined measures to raise an additional R15-billion in 2019-2020.

Increases in indirect taxes such as adjustments to the fuel levy and increases on excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco products will raise R1.2-billion.
