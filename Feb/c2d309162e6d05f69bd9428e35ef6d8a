The 2019 State of the nation address’s (Sona) theme for 2019 is: “Following up on our commitments — making your future work better”. SONA is called in terms of Section 42 of the Constitution by the president of the republic. It is a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament and one of the rare occasions that bring together the three arms of the state under one roof. The address affords President Cyril Ramaphosa an opportunity to speak to the nation on the general state of South Africa, to reflect on a wide range of political, economic and social matters within the domestic and global contexts, to account to the nation on the work of government and to set out the government’s program of action.
