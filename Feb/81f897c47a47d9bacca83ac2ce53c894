Mamelodi Sundowns comfortably dispatched with Black Leopards on Wednesday night, with a result that lands them one step closer to controlling the top position in the PSL. The first half gave us exactly what was expected going into this one: Sundowns domination. Reflecting at half time, there was barely a moment to remember from Dylan Kerr’s men. It was clear from their first kick that they came here to defend and counter-attack.
It’s just a pity for them that they weren’t particularly good at either. Their opponents meanwhile set about creating chances almost immediately. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>Anthony Laffor found space down the right and sent the ball into Lebohang Maboe who stretched but his header drifted over. After a chance for a goal in the opening 5 minutes faded, the next 20 settled into a predictable, if entertaining pattern. The home side took as many pot shots as they could without ever really threatening while the visitors attempted to hit back but without knowing the definition of threatening. From the half-an-hour mark the Brazilians decided it was time to show off the type of football they’re renowned for. One such gorgeous interplay saw captain Hlompho Kekana drive at the box before finding Laffour who this time sent the ball across goal but Maboe, instead of tapping in, again sent the ball over the bar. In the 41st minute, Maboe would finally make up for the squandered chances. Leopards thought they would finally make inroads into the opposing half after successfully defending a corner but Tsheamo Mashoene was disposed after Kekane expertly tracked back. The midfield general sent a floater over to Gaston Sirino who quickly dissected the defence to find Maboe for the easy finish. The home side managed to harness the same momentum as they came out for the second half and by the 53rd minute had all but wrapped up the game. Maboe this time looked to turn provider as he broke on the right and sent a driven cross from the byline — the velocity of the ball too great for Khomotso Masia whose poor attempt at a clearance sent the ball into the net instead. Contest over. Both sides happily played out most of the remaining time on autopilot; a few aimless long-trangers mixed in with some aimless passing. Themba Zwane would provide one last moment to cheer after his driven shot clashed with Pentjie Zulu’s hand and left the ref with no choice but to point to the spot. Ricardo Nascimento of course stepped up and sent the keeper the wrong way. Three-nil and a perfect reflection of Mamelodi dominance at its finest.
