The state capture commission’s legal team has urged its chair — Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo — to invoke his powers to summon individuals implicated in alleged corruption at Eskom. On Wednesday, evidence leader advocate Vincent Maleka SC, asked Zondo to invoke his powers to compel implicated persons to present their versions before the commission. The plea was made as the commission turns its focus on Eskom. On Wednesday, the commission’s legal team put on record a number of reports relating to investigations into the embattled power utility. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>A portfolio committee on public enterprises Eskom inquiry report and a report commissioned by national treasury are included in the bundle put before the commission. A number of former Eskom executives and government officials have been implicated in these reports. Parliament’s report recommended that former Eskom board chairs Zola Tsotsi and Ben Ngubane, former acting group chief executive Matshela Koko, former interim board chair Zethembe Khoza, former chief executive Brian Molefe, former chief financial officer Anoj Singh, former acting chief financial officer Sean Maritz and former board members Pathmanathan Naidoo and Devapushpum Naidoo appear before the Zondo commission. The committee’s report further implicated former public enterprises ministers Lynne Brown and Malusi Gigaba, as well as former mineral resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane. Treasury’s report concluded that former Singh, Koko, Suzanne Daniels, Ayanda Nteta and Edwin Mabelane should be investigated by the Hawks for receiving kickbacks in assisting the Guptas to receive a controversial R659-million prepayment to purchase Optimum coal mine from Glencore. Maleka noted that very few individuals implicated in state capture allegations have come forward to dispute witness testimonies. “We believe the time has come for the commission to have a balanced view of ... allegations of capture,” Maleka added. Former president Jacob Zuma has not applied to cross-examine any witnesses, despite being named on a number of occasions. The controversial Gupta brothers have applied to cross-examine witnesses, but Zondo has denied them this opportunity based on their refusal to appear before the commission in person.
