Golden Arrows coach Steve Komphela maintained an unbeaten record since joining the team in mid-season thanks to a 2-1 win over Highlands Park Saturday in the Absa Premiership. Former Bafana Bafana captain and centre-back Komphela has overseen three victories and two draws in all competitions since replacing the sacked Clinton Larsen. He spent three trophy-less seasons with giants Kaizer Chiefs before resigning and spent the first half of this season at cash-strapped Bloemfontein Celtic. Komphela abandoned Celtic in December after becoming increasingly frustrated with penny-pinching at the club which included not paying his monthly sport channel subscription. Danny Venter and Lerato Lamola scored for the Durban outfit before the visitors from Johannesburg halved the deficit through Ryan Rae 14 minutes from time. The 76th-minute header by Rae, whose careless pass led to Arrows’ second goal, set up a tense finish as league draw specialists Highlands sought an 11th stalemate in 19 outings. But Arrows survived to swap positions with Highlands in mid-table as they climbed one place to ninth while the losers slipped one spot to 10th. A waterlogged pitch in the central town of Bethlehem forced the postponement of the fixture between strugglers Free State Stars and sixth-placed Polokwane City. © Agence France-Presse
