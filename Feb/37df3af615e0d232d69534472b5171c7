Ratings agency Moody’s has said that splitting Eskom into three entities may make the power utility’s cost structure more transparent, but the split does little to address the debt-laden utility’s financial challenges. The agency on Monday published a research note in reaction to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address on Thursday, where he announced that Eskom would be split into three separate entities. The entities would all still fall under Eskom. The report is not a credit rating action. “[…] aside from very broad proposals to reduce financial stress at Eskom, the speech offered few concrete measures to overcome these structural challenges in the face of entrenched vested interests,” said its author, Lucie Villa, a Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer and lead sovereign analyst for South Africa. Villa said that while the unbundling paves the way for a more transparent group with “more clearly allocated revenue”, the group’s financial problems remain. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> Moody’s, she said, will be watching to see see how the government supports the power utility, what increase in electricity tariffs it is awarded by regulator Nersa, how and whether cost cutting goes ahead, and whether the state will be taking over any of Eskom’s debt. “Financial support to Eskom accompanied by measures that durably stabilises its financial health would be credit neutral,” said Villa. By contract, financial support without savings measures would be credit negative for South Africa. In his address on Thursday, Ramaphosa acknowledged that Eskom was a state of “crisis”, saying that the state would support Eskom’s balance sheet. The president said minister of finance Tito Mboweni would provide further details in the budget speech on February 20. Ramaphosa said this would be done without “burdening the fiscus with unmanageable debt”. Villa said Ramaphosa’s speech confirmed the government’s commitment to its policy agenda of reviving growth and job creation, but was short on details. “[...] structural rigidities in the labour market and corruption’s impact on investment will remain challenges and take a long time to overcome.” She said that, while Ramaphosa’s policies would likely arrest the long-term decline in SA’s growth potential, Moody’s does expect “any marked acceleration in growth in the next few years”. — Fin24
