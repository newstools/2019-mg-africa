In a knowledge society, 85% of all assets are intangible; about 70% of these assets are resident in people. People have moved to centre stage because they unlock value and create wealth through their creativity, ingenuity and innovation. Organisations, nations and societies that have the right people at the right time in the right place — able, willing and allowed to contribute — will dominate the future. A fundamental, radical transformation is occurring through four forces of change, bringing about a new world order: Infusing the above four forces of change, and feeding back into them, is the “maths” of the emerging new world order: “Intelligently respond twice as fast, deliver twice as much, at twice the speed, at half the cost, within half the accepted product and service lifespan, and doing all of this on a continuous, sustainable basis: everywhere, anytime, anyone, anyhow, anything.” This maths is fuelled by the competitive equation of this order: the continuous delivery of innovative, customised, high-quality products and services, simultaneously bringing costs down, and getting products and services more quickly to markets, from conception to commercialisation. The emerging new world order has invoked the imperative of relentless, disruptive (even destructive) innovation as the strategic success factor for organisations, nations and societies wanting to remain ready for the future — not just to survive, but to thrive. In turn, the relentless innovation has invoked the necessity for continuous deep relearning, learning and unlearning by all.
If individuals, organisations and societies do not learn and re-invent themselves faster than the rate of change, they will not have a future, because they have become obsolete. Higher education institutions play probably the most critical role in providing organisations, nations and society with the right people at the right time, in the right place, with the right capabilities to unlock value and create wealth, the critical driver of the knowledge society. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>The relentless innovation, requiring continuous learning, makes this expected role of these institutions even more critical. They will have to re-invent themselves if they wish to remain relevant. But, at best, higher education institutions are rapidly becoming mismatched in the new world order. At worst, they are becoming and are seen to be obsolete. In their confusion about how to address these forces of change, the institutions are responding inappropriately, by strengthening and maintaining the status quo through, for example, standardisation, centralisation and control. The forces of change instead demand shifts of 180˚ and different responses: flexibility, risk taking, resilience, continual innovation and high levels of empowerment at all levels. Typically, the leaders of higher education institutions are appointed into such positions because of their outstanding academic track records, not because of their proven ability to lead a complex organisation battered by the forces of change. At most, these leaders manifest a transactional leadership stance: keeping the bureaucratic, administrative machine working efficiently and smoothly. These leaders are expected to be status quo optimisers, adverse to the radical change required by the new world order. In instances where leaders claim to have adopted a transformational stance — the pursuit of an inspiring vision affecting radical change — nothing fundamentally changes in the institution. The overpowering institutional inertia and ruling hegemony of past traditions and internal academic coalitions — “we have always done it this way” — are overwhelmingly powerful. The exclusively claimed offering of higher education institutions is graduates and research. The institutions are under threat in terms of their conventional “inside-out, we-know-best” programmatic offering and mind-set. Inside their cozy ivory towers, academics decide what programmes must look like. Little attention is given to the externally required graduate. The World Economic Forum predicts that “by 2020 more than a third of the desired core skill sets of most occupations will comprise skills that are not yet even considered crucial to the job today”. Professions will change more in the next 25 years than in the previous 300 years. At best, the higher education institutions produce intellectual giants and outstanding, narrow, technical specialists who have little sense of true citizenship, and no strong moral conscience and compass. Business schools have been accused of propagating ideologically inspired, amoral theories that free students from any sense of moral responsibility. The worldwide 2008 economic crisis can be attributed to the likes of these graduates, who are unethical, greed-driven leaders, managers and specialists. They have no moral conscience regarding the wellbeing of the world economy and society, now and going into the future. With respect to research offering, higher education institutions have, in their pursuit of creeping up the global university rankings, become increasing imprisoned in their universe, chasing and producing research on topics that bear little relevance to societal needs. On top of this, the academic integrity and ethos of higher education institutions are eroded through plagiarism, predatory journals, bogus research and fake articles attributable to the “publish or perish” pressure placed on them. Four examples illustrate the institutions’ growing irrelevancy: The existing structure of these academic institutions is in direct lineage from the Middle Ages university: a pursuit of the holy grail of siloed, disciplinary specialisation aimed at knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Seeping through the structure is disempowering managerialism and stifling administrative bureaucratisation. Societal challenges necessitating integrated, holistic solutions and cross-disciplinary, social interventions, able to bring about lasting societal change in step with the new world, are ignored or downplayed by these institutions. Their typical structure is one of centralised command-and-control from an all-knowing top leadership dictating what needs to be done to make the machine work better. Or, at the other extreme, they have a laissez-faire attitude justified on the grounds of the holy grail of academic freedom. This is in stark contrast to the emerging new world order, which requires real-time, structural qualities such as flexibility, responsiveness and autonomy. The conventional institution of higher education delivers once-off education “events” that are time- and schedule-bound, tied to classroom locations and characterised by voluminous knowledge dumping. The aim is to make the education factory mass-produce cloned graduates who meet internally specified criteria that are tied to internally determined programme requirements. The concurrent massification of education has worsened this dynamic. Yet, the new world order demands just-in-time, time-space-free, immediately relevant knowledge dissemination enabled by a continual, seamless, two-way movement between theory and practice. These 10 guidelines are suggested so that higher education institutions become architects of their own future: Consider deconstructing the university into two broad types of academic units, each overseen by their own advisory boards, comprising trend-setting, external experts and stakeholders. (a) Sets of domain-related undergraduate departments (up to honours). These departments develop portfolios of technical specialists able to deliver integrated solutions in a team setting, across the total value chain of their respective disciplines; and (b) Multidisciplinary graduate schools (master’s and doctoral graduates, with research programmes). Each school focuses on a single sustainability issue as derived from the institution’s strategic intent. Each school would deliver graduates who, from a sustainability perspective, are able to socially contribute systemically at a strategic-tactical level in their employing organisations.
