Eight prison wardens who were fired for refusing to feed prisoners because they were participating in an illegal strike in 2015 have been reinstated retrospectively. The move, at a cost of R12-million, comes on the orders of controversial prisons boss Arthur Fraser. The eight, who are to be paid between R1.2-million and R1.3-million each, will be re-employed after Fraser, the national commissioner of correctional services, overturned a decision by KwaZulu-Natal prison bosses to oppose an order reinstating them. Their reinstatement was then ordered by the General Public Service Sector Bargaining Council, in April. Posts will have to be created at the Qalakabusha Correctional Centre in Empangeni to accommodate the eight because none are available. The decision is one of several taken by Fraser, who was moved to correctional services in April 2018 after serving as director general of the State Security Agency (SSA) since 2016.
