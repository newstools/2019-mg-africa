In a performance and political career that spanned more than six decades, Ndikho Xaba’s effect is perhaps best measured by the force of his ideas and how he interacted with others, as opposed to how much music he recorded. A multi-instrumentalist, performer, singer, spiritualist and, most of all, activist, Xaba skipped the country as a lead in the cast of Sponono, a play by Alan Paton that hit Broadway in 1964. He remained in exile until the late 1990s. At the height of the Black Power movement and the spiritual jazz era, Xaba led the San Francisco-based group Ndikho Xaba and the Natives through garage recordings that yielded their eponymous album, released in 1971. “I became aware of him while he was in exile,” says musicologist Sazi Dlamini.
