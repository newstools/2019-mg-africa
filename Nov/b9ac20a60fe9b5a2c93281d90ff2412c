When it came time to form Mabuta, bass player and group founder Shane Cooper says he knew exactly who to turn to for the group’s drum sound (Marlon Witbooi) “because of his diverse set of interests musically”. As a member of several groups inlcuding Skyjack, the Reza Khota Quartet, the Kyle Shepherd Trio and a Zurich-based quintet called Zuintet, Cooper plays with various drummers, each with a different approach to music, invariably colouring his own perspective In this interview, he elaborates on what each of those individuals brings to the table  Marlon is the first drummer I went to because of his diverse set of interests musically.
If a drummer gets my sensibilities from the beginning without me having to show him too much, it means I can just slot in at a super comfortable level as a bass player and then the process of working on the music happens very naturally because the groove is there from the very beginning.

Of course there is the groove and all of that, but every drummer tunes their drums differently and has a specific set of cymbals and a way that they orchestrate the drums. I’m a big fan of how Kes orchstrates the drums and his sound. How does he influence your playing on the bandstand? It’s hard for me to say because of all the drummers I have played with, I have played with Kes and Jonno [Sweetman] the longest. Me and Kes have worked together on great projects since 2006. It’s kind of hard to say because we almost have a sibling relationship at this point. If I’d only been playing with him for a few years it would be easier to reflect on it. We’ve got a specific style where, if Kes and I step on stage, we got a specific book that we both open. We play a specific way together. I know when he’s doing a frill where he’s going to land. We just have a second nature together.        View this post on Instagram              Soundcheck vibes @mombellimusic @kyleshepherdmusic @keenanahrends . Gig starts at 20h30 Norval Foundation. Carlo Mombelli Angels and Demons A post shared by  Jonno Sweetman (@jonno_sweetman) on Oct 26, 2019 at 9:53am PDT Jonno is one of the most dynamic drummers that I have worked with. He has got a huge range, from the most beautiful, delicate quiet stuff to loud energy. We come from rock music to a large extent, from our youth. It’s a certain sensibility that creeps up now and again and it’s allowed to shine through in projects like the Kyle Shepherd Trio, but we’ve done a whole bunch of other stuff as well. Jonno’s got an amazing groove sensibility and I think he’s an amazing listener and can quickly be responsive to a different direction you might suggest in the music. It’s a great quality to have.        View this post on Instagram              A.

So there’s another kind of element to his playing that allows me to express other ideas that I don’t play as much with Jonno and Kes, for example.
