Sugar and property giant Tongaat Hulett, crippled by a Steinhoff-style corporate governance scandal, will start retrenching workers and evicting them from its farms from the end of this month. Although the full extent of the retrenchments by the company are not yet known, up to 5 000 jobs, mainly in its sugar division, are on the line as a result of the company’s huge financial losses.
