A British man called Thomas Cook said on Monday he feared his dream wedding in Greece was ruined after the collapse of the holiday company with the same name. Cook (29) is on the island of Rhodes with his partner Amelia Binch (27 and their two children ahead of their planned wedding this Friday. But they worry the ceremony may not go ahead while they wait to be repatriated, and some guests are still in Britain, the Nottingham Post newspaper reported. “Thomas Cook promised us a surprise on our wedding because of my name but this was not the surprise we were expecting,” he told the paper. The couple, from the town of Hucknall near Nottingham in central England, said they had spent almost £10 000 on a wedding package with Thomas Cook. “I am just devastated. We have got 30-plus friends and family coming out; half are stuck at home in limbo.
My best man is still in England. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>No one here knows anything,” Cook said. “I have been planning this for two years and it has all gone to pot. We have paid for everything. It is shattering. We don’t know what we can do.” The travel group collapsed into bankrupcy on Monday, leaving about 600 000 holidaymakers stranded. The British government is planning to bring home about 150 000 Britons stuck abroad, in the country’s biggest repatriation since World War II. — AFP
