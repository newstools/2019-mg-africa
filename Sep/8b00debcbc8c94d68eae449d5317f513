That is nearly five times the global average and is the fourth highest on the planet. Many victims are betrayed by the criminal justice system. In the first part of a series, the Mail & Guardian tells the story of Viwe Dalingozi’s violent death, a botched investigation and her family’s despairing quest for justice Richard Keedwell claimed he ‘could not believe’ he had been speeding and that he had ‘no case to answer’ The co-founder of a union has championed the rights of those in an often ignored sector Zweli Ndaba wrote the flyer that spurred hostel residents and truck drivers to take part in the shutdown that led to the violence in Jo’burg A report by the auditor general said most municipalities, which are supposed to be on the front line of service delivery, were in financial difficulty This week, President Cyril Ramaphosa made his first appointments to the Constitutional Court: Supreme Court of Appeal judges Zukisa Tshiqi and Stevan Majiedt.
