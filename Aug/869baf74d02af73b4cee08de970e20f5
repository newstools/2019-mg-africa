Earlier this week PhD student and author Lebohang Masango sat with Power FM’s Aldrin Sampear to talk about her Master’s dissertation. With Johannesburg as her case study, the topic focuses on how young women navigate love and intimacy in the digital era of capitalism. “The thing about romance is that [it] requires money,” Masango explained to Sampear.
“There is no engagement in any kind of romance without money. It’s a material activity. So for us to then want to create a moral panic around what young women, who are consenting adults, are doing with their bodies, or are setting as criterias for romantic engagement, I don’t think it warrants the moral panic that it has.” The Mail & Guardian collaborated with Masango to create a playlist that speaks to what she refers to as “strategic dating”, from women’s point of view.
