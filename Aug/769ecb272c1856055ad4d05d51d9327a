Bungling by the Hawks has cost the new investigation into the death in detention in 1977 of Hoosen Haffejee the evidence of a crucial witness who was detained and tortured with him. In early 2018 the witness reversed his decision to give evidence about the dentist’s last hours alive after Hawks investigators arrived two weeks late to take his statement.
