On Wednesday, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema told journalists he plans to sue Thembinkosi Rawula for R1-million over what he claims are defamatory comments made by the party’s former head of disciplinary commission. Rawula has since resigned from the party, calling on the party to show its financial audits from the past four years. In a Facebook post last week, Rawula accused Malema and his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, of financial mismanagement and of accepting a donation from now-defunct VBS Mutual Bank. “We reiterate that our financial standing as an organisation is at its best, demonstrated by the fact that Parliament, [provincial] legislatures and the IEC [Electoral Commission of South Africa] have all given EFF money for five years.
We have noted with keen interest that there are people who because they did not find expression in the EFF final list to parliament, have decided to break rank,” Malema said. The leader of the Red Berets added that he has not taken money from the party, saying Rawula must go to the treasurer general of the EFF if he wants to see the party’s finances. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>He then vowed to “clean out”  Rawula, saying his lawyers are already in the process of finalising a summons against the former EFF member. Rawula’s allegations were personal and had nothing to do with the EFF, so they will now meet in court, the EFF leader said.
