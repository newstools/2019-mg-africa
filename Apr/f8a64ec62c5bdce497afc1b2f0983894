I’m from a township in Pretoria called Soshanguve. Growing up, there were a lot of gangs and violence.
As a boy, you have to choose your friends and your path very carefully. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>But it’s difficult when you’re young and lack the opportunities. When I was 12 years old, I contracted pneumonia. I almost passed away. I’ve been an asthmatic all my life, but when I got pneumonia it was really bad. I couldn’t breathe. I was vomiting and struggling with a fever. When you go through an event like that in your life — when you feel like you’re dying — there’s a lot of things that change. I was constantly struggling with questions like “Why me?” and “Why am I struggling with this?” I think I realised the value of life and what it means to be human. I was only 12 but I grew up very quickly, which was really important. With the support of my parents, I pulled through after two weeks in hospital. During my time in hospital, I found the medical industry fascinating. I grasped on to every opportunity that came my way after that. Unlike a lot of my friends at the time, I took education seriously. I ended up going to med school in 2006, finished in 2011 and moved to Jo’burg. I practise as a doctor in obstetrics and gynaecology today. I’m probably delivering about 20 babies a week. I love it. I really do. It’s one of the most extraordinary feelings you’ll ever have, seeing someone coming out of the ward with a big smile on their face. — Dr Thabang Kgatle, as told to Jacques Coetzee
