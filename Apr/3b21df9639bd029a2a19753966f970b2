[CDC Response]: The CDC has consistently acted within defined parameters of the Service Delivery Agreement (SDA) and provisions that govern interaction between arms of government. The statement by the former health employee is devoid of any truth.
It is important to note that the CDC claims have been affirmed by independent processes, which culminated in the following sequence of events: [Article]: “Tuswa wants the Hawks to investigate Coega’s bank accounts…” [CDC Response]: As already indicated in our previous response, the CDC notes the statement and will await interaction from the Hawks and/or law enforcement agencies, suffice to state that the accounts of the CDC are audited by the Auditor General of South Africa (AGSA). <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> [Article]: “The R111-million is said to be an irregular portion of a total R150 million that was paid to Coega as the result of an arbitration award in September last year, after a drawnout battle between the Eastern Cape health department and the entity….” [CDC Response]: Once again the above statement is grossly incorrect and does not take into account the amount litigated by the CDC was made an order of the Grahamstown High Court and fully ventilated in the arbitration process [refer to sequence of events paragraph contained in this response]. Furthermore, (1) Interim Award on paragraphs 207 to 222 fully explains the award arguments and (2) Annexure IA1 captures the calculated amount inclusive of the R111m. Moreover, the tribunal also issued an (3) Article 37 Interpretation of Award dated 28 September 2018 which dealt with the R111m specifically. Furthermore, as previously indicated, the claim was for Management fees that the CDC charged for the implementation of work done by the organisation on behalf of ECDOH. The basis of which, are fully ventilated in the SDA signed by both parties and independently interpreted by the Tribunal. The associated invoices were submitted to ECDoH with relevant supporting information/documentation. The CDC claimed costs based on a recognised fee scale as prescribed in the Department of Public Service and Administration (the DPSA) Schedule, Department of Public Works guidelines and the Engineering Profession Act 2000, as amended by Government Gazette No. 28643 of 31 March 2006 and as amended from time-to- time. [Article]: “Mbengashe wrote to the tribunal asking it how it had arrived at the amount…” [CDC Response]: Kindly note, the tribunal comprehensively responded to this item under the heading – ARTICLE 37 INTERPRETATION OF AWARD. This is contained as part of our response for ease of reference. [Article]: “…Tuswa said the arbitration process was flawed because the panel selection was controlled by Coega,...” [CDC Response]: The CDC rejects this assertion as stated in the article – “a claim the agency denies. It said the process was agreed upon by both parties.” However, what the article fell short of detailing was the objective and independent process that was followed to appoint the Arbitrators. A process which the CDC comprehensively outlined in its previous response to the Mail & Guardian, further outlined below: [Article]: ”CDC had submitted its claim largely based on using a nonexisting service level agreement alleged by Coega Development Corporation to have been signed by both parties during the 2014-15 financial year…” [CDC Response]: As indicated in our previous response, the CDC submitted its claims based on the 2009 Service Delivery Agreement (SDA), which remains in force until the discharge of all contractual obligations. [Article]: “…during the planning stage of projects and progress on site during implementation …” said Silindile Manqina, communications officer in Silinga’s office,...” [CDC Response]: The CDC requested in writing that the Mail & Guardian attributes all comments to the CDC spokesperson – Dr. Ayanda Vilakazi, CDC’s Head of Marketing, Brand and Communications, dully authorized to speak on behalf of the CDC.
