According to a Citizen report, former apartheid-era civil co-operation bureau (CCB) agent Ferdinand Barnard was released from prison on Tuesday morning. Barnard was serving time for the 1989 murder of anti-apartheid activist and anthropologist, David Webster. Barnard was granted parole on March 7 by Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha, who had announced Barnard would be released on April 2. Barnard was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1998, a decade after killing Webster outside his Troyeville home in 1989.
Barnard would later be convicted for the attempted murder of another activist, Dullah Omar, who served in both former president Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki’s Cabinets. Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said that Barnard’s release date was set for Tuesday, April 2, but did not confirm whether the former CCB agent had been released. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> Masutha said that Barnard had met all the requirements for his release on parole, but it does not mean that it is the end of his life sentence. The community corrections office will supervise and monitor him as he serves the remainder of his sentence in the community for the rest of his natural life.
