The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) has received objections to two of the ANC’s highest ranking officials — ANC deputy president David Mabuza and chairman Gwede Mantashe — who feature in the number two and three slots of the party’s national list of individuals it would like to send to Parliament. The IEC has received objections to over 20 candidates on the ANC’s list of MPs and members of provincial legislatures spanning across factions — those aligned to both the “reformists” and those loyal to former president Jacob Zuma.
Both groups are entangled in allegations of state capture and corruption, according to a letter to the party from the commission, which the Mail & Guardian has seen. The IEC released party lists for public comment last week. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> Any member of the public can raise an objection to any of the candidates on the list. The letter from the IEC did not indicate who had raised the objection. The objection period closed on Tuesday, April 2 and parties are now being afforded the opportunity to respond to the objections. Parties received the letters this week and were given until April 3 to respond to them. The IEC will notify those who made the objections on the outcome of the process by April 8. According to the letter, objections were also received against current MPs Nomvula Mokonyane, Malusi Gigaba, Bathabile Dlamini, Mosebenzi Zwane, David Mahlobo, Tina Joemat-Pettersson, Zweli Mkhize, Angie Motshekga, Yunus Carrim, Thoko Didiza, Cedric Frolick, Vincent Smith as well as ANC head of the Presidency Zizi Kodwa. The letter informing the ANC of objections said the reasons included that the conduct of the individuals were viewed as “unbecoming of persons wanting to become or continue to be office bearers”. “The submissions consists of various allegations against the candidates reflected on the ANC’s candidate list in respect of conduct listed below,” the letter said. “1. Allegations of corruption… due to the ongoing revelations as canvassed via the Zondo commission, various court cases and information provided via news agencies and social media. “2. Allegations of criminal acts carried out by some members who have been accused of inter alia theft, fraud and rape,” the letter read. The M&G has confirmed the letter’s authenticity. The IEC would not comment on letters it had sent to individual political parties. Similar letters were sent to other political parties, who had objections lodged against candidates on their lists. IEC chief electoral officer Sy Mamabolo, in a statement on the process in general, said the commission received objections to candidates in nine political parties affecting 53 individuals on their lists.
