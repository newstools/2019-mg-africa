President Cyril Ramaphosa has given Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi until April 16 to respond to a report into whether they are fit for their posts at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), said a statement from the Presidency on Thursday. Jiba, one of the NPA’s four deputy national directors, and Mrwebi, the head of its specialised commercial crime unit, were suspended after they were roundly criticised in a number of court judgments in politically sensitive cases. Ramaphosa then established an inquiry into whether they are fit for office — chaired by retired Constitutional Court Justice Yvonne Mokgoro. After six weeks of public hearings, Mokgoro handed the report to Ramaphosa on April 1, but it will only be publicly released once Jiba and Mrwebi have “had an opportunity to consider it, make their representations and the President has considered such representations,” according to the statement issued by the Presidency on Thursday. “The President has shared the report with advocates Jiba and Mrwebi and requested them to submit any representations they may have in response to the findings to the President by Tuesday, 16 April 2019,” the statement reads. Among other claims made during the public hearings, Mokgoro’s panel heard evidence that Jiba had authorised racketeering charges against retired KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Johan Booysen when there was no basis to do so, with Booysen saying he believed his prosecution was politically motivated. The commission also heard testimony that Mrwebi, with Jiba’s support, had withdrawn corruption charges against former crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli in order to protect him. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>They both denied wrongdoing and brought their own evidence to counter the claims.
