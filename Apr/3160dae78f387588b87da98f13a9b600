On Monday, Paul Pretorius SC, evidence leader at the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture, announced two applications for postponement. Former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride will now testify on Thursday.
The testimony of former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks boss Johan Booysen will be postponed to next week Monday. The Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture kicked off this week with the announcement of the postponement of the testimony of former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride. McBride is set to give evidence on the alleged capture of the criminal justice cluster, including the South African Police Service and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on Thursday. McBride was scheduled to appear before the commission — chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo — in February, but his testimony was postponed to allow the legal team to notify individuals implicated in his evidence. The head of the commission’s legal team, Paul Pretorius SC, revealed in February that McBride’s testimony will implicate more than 30 people, many of them high-ranking officials. These include the former minister of police, Nathi Nhleko, and the former national director of public prosecutions, Shaun Abrahams. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> The Mail & Guardian understands that McBride has more than 2 000 pages of evidence in the form of recordings and documents. In October last year, McBride said in Ipid’s annual report that the directorate “has already started investigations into the role of police officers for defeating the ends of justice to undermine investigations into allegations of state capture”. He further stated that Ipid was “the first institution to call out state capture in the criminal justice cluster”. It is expected that McBride’s testimony will deal with how Nhleko was allegedly determined to get rid of him as the head of Ipid. In 2015, McBride was accused of covering up then Hawks boss Anwa Dramat’s alleged involvement in the illegal rendition of Zimbabweans in 2010. McBride was suspended by Nhleko. Criminal charges over the renditions were brought against Dramat, McBride and former Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya but were later withdrawn against all three. Shortly after McBride’s scheduled appearance before the commission in February, Parliament ratified the decision by the portfolio committee on police not to renew his contract as Ipid head. In January, McBride approached the high court in Pretoria to review and set aside the decision by Police Minister Bheki Cele not to renew his contract. McBride argued in his founding papers that the head of Ipid should not function at the behest of a political appointee as this may lead to interference. But in February, the portfolio committee on police recommended that McBride’s contract should not be renewed. This article was updated to reflect the postponement of former Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride’s testimony before the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture.
