The newly appointed board of the SABC has moved to replace Chris Maroleng, who was dismissed last week, by appointing Dr Craig Van Rooyen as acting chief operations officer (COO) with immediate effect. The SABC issued a statement acknowledging Van Rooyen’s career and why he has been chosen to be the acting COO at the public broadcaster. In the statement, the national broadcaster said Van Rooyen joined the SABC on November 1 2018. He was in charge of the technological operations team, which includes developing and executing vital techniques to further the broadcaster’s corporate plan. “During his 28-year career, Van Rooyen has held important posts at both Vodacom and Telkom which included operations management, credit management, marketing and sales and wholesale and technology,” the statement reads. During his tenure at Vodacom, Van Rooyen held the position of executive for the group’s technology efficiency and transformation, establishing and driving effectiveness programs in South Africa, Mozambique, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Kenya, Tanzania and most recently Ghana.  He is also a part-time lecturer at the Wits Business School. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>The SABC said its staff will support Van Rooyen as he begins his new role at the broadcaster.
