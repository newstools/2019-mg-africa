About a blink of an eye ago, it seemed that Eskom might be able to see its way out of the financial woods. The government, in the person of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, agreed in the February budget to a R23-billion a year lifeline, which could last for at least 10 years. It was mooted to plug a R150-billion hole in Eskom’s finances, but then the National Energy Regulator of South Africa rejected its 17%-15% tariff application for the next three years, allowing for 9.4%-8.1%-5.2% instead. The pundits estimate this means a R100-billion or so shortfall over and above what Mboweni has already stumped up on our behalf.
