Maphumulo was wanted by police after a video showing him assaulting long-term partner Simelane went viral on social media late on Sunday evening. Speaking at a short media briefing in Durban on Tuesday morning, Simelane’s parents thanked the South African public for their support. Simelane herself was not present at the briefing as she is currently receiving medical treatment after the incident, her parents said.
