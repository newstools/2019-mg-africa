I came to South Africa for tertiary education after struggling for four years to get into a college in Nigeria. At first I did not like it.
It was hell to kind of settle in, but in my third and fourth month in South Africa, I was walking through town and Braamfontein. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>I am a very adaptive person, so I was just making friends and meeting people. So one day I am walking, where Nandos is in Braam, there was a café behind it where it was like a creative hub. I saw a sign, which said something about an “open mic”. So I used to sing and I walked in there hoping I will meet like-minded people. It was so much fun! I liked what they did, so I asked to volunteer to wash their dishes. So after school I would go there and make coffee for people. I made good coffee and I could bake so after a month or two they hired me to help run the café kitchen during the school holidays.  They paid me something like R2 000 a month. That time was a pivotal moment in my life because I met all these amazing creatives there — people who now work at media houses. I found a community that helped me to begin my adaptation in South Africa. Before then I did not even know what an open mic was. That space was just filled with dreams and it just made me feel like, okay cool, I could also be one of these people, I could also be cool! The spirit of creativity that I found at Hei Café helped me to thrive and people there were daring to dream. That place there was the root of everything. I now work at Africori, where I am a communications specialist. — Titilope “Titi” Adesanya as told to Tshegofatso Mathe
