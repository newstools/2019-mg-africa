I got booked for this show at a club in town. That was my first big performance.
You know how it usually is: they book, like, different artists and they put you on the list. That day there were just DJs playing and I was the only rapper and I was pretty nervous but it ended up being the best performance. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>It was challenging because you can’t compare house music and hip-hop. House is always going to move the crowd and you don’t want to be the one who ends up slowing the crowd down. It was in a club and so what people are looking for is music that is bouncy, and that’s what the DJ was playing. So I thought: “If I can go first I’ll just play my part and then I’m gone.” But things turned out very well for me. It was the most lovely night of my life. I was able to perform and give a dope performance and everyone responded well to it. It was my first introduction to a crowd, you know. I remember that I was supposed to just perform about two or three songs. But the DJ ended up adding another song because everybody was just having fun. It felt good. It really felt good. When I walked out many people approached me. They wanted to be close. I was so excited. I’ll never forget it. So for me it was very exciting to know that everybody loves what I am doing. And that I had everybody’s attention. That was the best performance I have ever had. Since that time I have performed in different places and just had a nice crowd response, but that time I just felt like everybody was enjoying what I was doing. — Kalvin “Trixmilli” Mpofu, as told to Sarah Smit
