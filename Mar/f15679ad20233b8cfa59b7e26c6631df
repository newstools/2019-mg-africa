President Cyril Ramaphosa’s son Andile admitted on Wednesday he was paid R2-million by Bosasa. “It was a severe oversight on our part,” Andile told News24 of a deal his company signed with the Bosasa group in December 2017. His company Blue Crane Capital signed an “advisory mandate” with Bosasa, resulting in it being receiving a monthly retainer fee of R150 000, which was later bumped up to R230 000.
Blue Crane Capital was contracted to provide advice on more than 20 public and private sector contracts in Uganda and Kenya. “It is clear now with the benefit of hindsight that our due diligence was insufficient in retrospect of my father’s role going into the Presidency,” the younger Ramaphosa said in a written response to questions from News24. Both father and son have previously refused to divulge details or the value of the agreement despite Promotion of Access to Information Act requests and questions in the National Assembly. Bosasa, which is now known as African Global Operations, was a conglomerate involved in bidding for and running lucrative government contracts. Several suspects including the company’s former chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi appeared at the specialised commercial crimes court on Wednesday over the alleged theft of money from contracts with the department of correctional services. The case was postponed to July. “It is clear now with the benefit of hindsight that our due diligence was insufficient in retrospect of my father’s role going into the Presidency,” Andile Ramaphosa told News24. There is no suggestion Andile Ramaphosa or his company were involved in the alleged corruption at the centre of the ongoing criminal case. Agrizzi, in his testimony before the commission of inquiry into state capture, has made sweeping corruption allegations against government officials including ministers who served during former president Jacob Zuma’s time in office. President Ramaphosa has sought, ahead of elections on May 8, to detoxify and distance the governing party which has been implicated  in numerous corruption scandals. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>
