Wednesday. I’m totally gutted. My dreams of Atletico Madrid taking this season’s Champions League are dead. My vision of seeing coach Diego Simeone hefting the trophy aloft on June 1 at Madrid’s Estadio Metropolitano, the club’s home ground since September 2017, wielding it triumphantly over his head like some kind of gilded battleaxe, is gone, banished by a 3-0 hammering the night before at the hands of Juventus in general and Cristiano Ronaldo in particular. To be honest, Atleti were never really in the game on Tuesday night, despite having put Juve away 2-0 in the first leg.
