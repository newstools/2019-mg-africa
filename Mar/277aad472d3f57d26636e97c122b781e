I was on my way to work at a garage in Whittlesea on a Saturday morning in 2006. While I was walking, I was hit by the feeling that the time was right.
I turned back after making the decision that, come Monday morning, I was leaving for Jo’burg. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div> I also decided to leave without telling my family because they’d ask me too many questions. You see, I knew that to leave home would mean that I would have to live on the streets of Jo’burg because I knew no one here. I slept at my friend’s house until Monday, when I sneaked back home to get a few clothes and caught the 7am train leaving Queenstown. The only thing I told my friend was that “ngiyofuna impilo e Jozi”, I am going to look for life in Jozi. I had been thinking about leaving the town of Whittlesea for a while before that Saturday. People pass matric there but you find them on the street corners day in and day out. I dropped out before matric so what chance did I have of making a life for myself there? When I arrived, I just walked around Park Station the whole day and slept there. On the second day, someone showed me where the shelters are and how to hustle for food. I wasn’t scared. I just didn’t want the sun to set each day because I’d have to find somewhere new to sleep. I only went home again in 2011. I was still on and off the streets and working here and there. But look at me now. My family can’t believe it. — In 2015 Nceba Tshizana (38) started working as a gardener at the David Krut Bookstore and now handles books and assists with installing exhibitions.
