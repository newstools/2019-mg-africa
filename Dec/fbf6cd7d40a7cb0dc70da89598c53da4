But why all this absorption with bricks and walls? One answer is suggested in the dissident literature and fin-de-siècle artistic practices that flourished in the embattled 1980s, the final decade of minority rule in South Africa. In his 1981 essay The Babalaz People, playwright Matsemela Manaka argued that “mampara bricks” (a low-grade stock brick meant to be plastered over), along with corrugated zinc and the mud and stench of township streets, formed an essential part of the mise en scène of authentic urban black theatre. Manaka’s comment is useful in expanding the terms of Rhode’s fidelity to place.
