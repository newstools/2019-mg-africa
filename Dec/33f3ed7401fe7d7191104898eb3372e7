A few hundred refugees and asylum seekers who have been housed in a central Cape Town church have promised to leave by the weekend. The group of a few hundred people have been living inside the Greenmarket Square Methodist Church since their forced removal by police from the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) at the end of October. A similar occupation took place at the Pretoria UNHCR offices last month. Their leaving the church will end months of tensions between the refugees, the government and humanitarian agencies. The group was demanding that they be taken to another country because they no longer felt safe in South Africa. Their imminent departure is also motivated by the deaths of four boys from the group, who drowned after being swept out to sea by strong currents off Three Anchor Bay, near the city centre, two weeks ago.At the time of their drowning, the boys’ relatives said they had gone swimming to escape the close living quarters of the church. Papi Sakumi, one of the group’s leaders, said: “We were asked by the pastor of the church to wait till after the burial of those boys before we leave. But we’ll hopefully be gone by the weekend.
