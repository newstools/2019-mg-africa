When 52-year-old KwaZulu-Natal based primary school principal Londumusa Mashiyane first deposited R10 000 into his Luno wallet to buy cryptocurrency at the beginning of August, he hoped his new venture would yield positive returns. Five months later — and with more than R179 000 deposited into his Luno wallet — Mashiyane had lost it all: he had no money and no cryptocurrency. His troubles started when a “Mr Adams” contacted him by phone and excitedly informed him that he had accumulated R5-million in his Luno wallet.
