‘I make people very uncomfortable, but fortunately I got into the Economic Freedom Fighters as an adult and I had already fought many battles,” says EFF Gauteng chairperson Mandisa Mashego. Amid preparations for the party’s second elective and policy conference this weekend, Mashego took some time to speak to the Mail & Guardian about the possible formation of a women’s wing. She starts by putting us on hold to wrap up another call. Mashego’s no-nonsense attitude earned her the reputation of being a “shit-stirrer” long before she joined the EFF soon after it launched in 2013, she says. Having been in her role as the only woman provincial leader in the EFF for just over a year, Mashego touches on her experience in South Africa’s third-largest political party. “When you fight you must know that you are going to be a casualty,” she says on the phone, adding that in fighting for certain issues, you tend to become a “bogeyman or bogeywoman”. “This is a generational fight. You fight for women and, if you benefit … you’re the shit-stirrer.” Ahead of the conference, a party insider said Mashego will be contesting the position of secretary general, a role currently held by Godrich Gardee. Mashego will likely go head-to-head with the favoured EFF MP Marshall Dlamini, who is said to be closely linked to party leader Julius Malema. Numerous slates have been touted on social media, with Malema on all of them. The rest of the top six positions are also up for grabs, with Mashego being on a slate that includes current party chairperson Dali Mpofu. Although Mashego confirms there have been “healthy discussions” within the party about the upcoming leadership battle, she declines to comment on whether she would be available to take up a position in the leadership. Such discussions tend to “polarise members and create unnecessary divisions”, she says. Mashego is going into the EFF’s four-day conference backing calls for a women’s wing.
