Student governance at the University of Zululand (UniZulu) continues to be in tatters, with no functional student representative council (SRC) in place. For a third successive year, the university has appointed an SRC administrator in the place of an elected SRC body. This is despite a budget of R5-million between 2009 and 2018 for SRC elections, a figure revealed by the department of higher education, science and technology in a parliamentary question last year. This means that no elected students have been running the body, meant to deal with the issues of its students, since 2016, despite the money being spent to have elections.
