We all know that Eskom needs a Big Fix before it drags the whole economy down with it, but we also know that there is a strong narrative which says government is constrained by organised labour. So it will come as something of a surprise to learn that trade union federation and ruling alliance member, Cosatu has tabled an ambitious and bold rescue plan to keep the country creditworthy and out of the hands of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The plan calls for the custodian of the pension savings of state employees, the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), to invest R200-billion into Eskom as part of a R250-billion equity injection to reduce its runaway interest bill and to return it to fiscal sustainability. Eskom has said that it needs its debt to be reduced by from R450-billion to R200-billion for it to function as an entity which can pay its own way. The proposal by Cosatu is for the remaining R50-billion to be made up by development finance institutions such as the Development Bank of SA, Industrial Development Corporation and the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF). The PIC, which has assets under management of R1.8-trillion, holds R104-billion of Eskomâ€™s debt, R95-billion on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) and R9-billion for the UIF.
