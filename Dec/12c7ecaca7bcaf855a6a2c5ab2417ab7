The number of calls to 10111 call centres has almost doubled in the past year, but workers and their union say there is not enough capacity to answer all of them. According to reports, before her brutal murder, 21-year-old Capricorn TVET College student Precious Ramabulana attempted to call the emergency number but could not get through. One of Ramabulanaâ€™s friends who lived in the adjoining room also reportedly tried to call 10111, but she also could not get through. Ramabulana was raped and stabbed more than 50 times.
