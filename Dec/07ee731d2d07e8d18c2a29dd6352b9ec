This photograph is from a recent series of mine, Faith & Ambiguity. It was made during an incubator programme at the Market Photo Workshop.
My initial project idea involved photographing strangers. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>Instead, I decided to photograph something familiar: my family and their connection to the Methodist Church, in an attempt to “return the gaze”. One of the places I went to was the church I grew up in, the Manning Road Methodist Church in Durban. I went upstairs and sat in a corner, waiting for moments to photograph. My images are often quite far away, as discussed in reviews. Even though this series was about being in a familiar space, it could be seen that I would intentionally place myself on the periphery and was once again “looking in”. This is where the ambiguity part stands out, more than in a religious sense. Many of the people I photographed have watched me grow up, but from the photos you would not know of that intimacy. Some individuals are still present, and other people are vague names and faces. I think that’s an honest way of life. You meet new people, you reconnect with ones from years ago. In the broader series there are people I still see or speak to just as there are people I have no deep or existing relationship with. Several individuals were comfortable with the presence of my camera, because of our existing relationship. My father Michael, a minister and former bishop; Lauren, another minister who I sometimes babysit for (and who has babysat me); Hazel, the secretary of the Natal Coastal Bishop’s office. There was never a negotiation of how the photos were made. Had this series been more disconnected, and had I pursued the first project of photographing people I did not know, I would never have realised the importance of interrogating one’s own experiences of spaces. The collaborative aspect is more natural, albeit a challenge to make your own story translate well into a seamless visual narrative. Select photographs have been exhibited at the Market Photo Workshop and The African Art Centre. A multimedia version is online.
