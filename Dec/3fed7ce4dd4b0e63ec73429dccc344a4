Regina Mohlomi is unassuming when she’s not wearing her official black robe or carrying a gigantic gold-plated mace. If you saw the former teacher out of her parliamentary role, you’d be forgiven for thinking she was a headmistress, or an accountant, or the manager of a white-collar office. But, for almost a decade, she’s had a front-row seat to the turbulences and successes of parliamentary politics. Mohlomi retires this year as South Africa’s first woman serjeant-at-arms. In modern parliamentary democracies, it is a ceremonial role, meant to hold up the traditions and procedures of the legislative body. “I always prefer the softer side of the job. The protocol, the decorum,” Mohlomi says. There have been times, however, when she has had to be stern to maintain order in Parliament which, in recent years, has been the site of physical confrontation and forced removals of certain members, most notably of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Mohlomi down plays the chaotic moments, however, saying that that was only a small part of her job. But, in 2014, she was called to give evidence before a parliamentary disciplinary committee after 22 of the 25 EFF MPs in the house had to be forcibly removed by security. The MPs stalled a question and answer session with then-president Jacob Zuma when they chanted “pay back the money”. During her testimony she told the committee how she personally asked the MPs, including EFF leader Julius Malema, to vacate the house or else she’d be forced to call in security.
