The department of mineral resources and energy needs an estimated R49-billion to rehabilitate about 6 000 mines abandoned by their owners. These mines are a legacy of a time when mining companies could walk away from their environmental liabilities — leaving poisons and heavy metals to leak into rivers and deadly dust to blow across the land. An average of about R120-million is spent annually on rehabilitating these mines. These numbers emerged during the department’s briefing of the portfolio committee for mineral resources and energy on November 20. Director general Abednigo Hlungwani said the department is now responsible for these mines — alongside the human settlements, water and sanitation department. Hlungwani told the committee that its priority is to rehabilitate 245 asbestos sites, because pollution from these mines causes serious lung diseases. To date, 27 asbestos mines have been rehabilitated. This article is only available to Mail & Guardian subscribers at present. Please login or consider subscribing.
