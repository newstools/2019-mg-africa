Tied by Time: Mixed media artist Tamlin Blake has created a tapestry installation akin to a Renaissance painting in its size, thematic conception and intricate detail. The installation is suspended from a large, wooden loom and features five scenes that take the viewer on a journey that makes its way through society’s technological developments and the way they have affected the human experience. Through weaving, Blake creates scenes that include events — such as the first industrial revolution, the invention of electricity, and the invention of the computer and the internet — leading up to the fourth industrial revolution.
