Corporate Social Responsibility has long been an “evolving” business practice. Today more corporates are realising the value of creating shared value to address social inequalities, and are investing in initiatives that will have socioeconomic and environmental impact beyond mere philanthropy. This year, General Electric (GE) is celebrating 120+ Years in Africa by examining the impact it’s had across its business operations.
Fatima Moosa spoke to Lee Dawes, GE Steam Power chief executive and regional leader for sub-Saharan Africa, on the company’s commitment towards supporting sustainable development through technological innovation, skills development and localisation. GE has always believed (and still believes) in Africa’s growth potential. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>We pledged to support South Africa in its early transformation journey to build an inclusive economy across industries such as energy, transportation, mining and health that would have a significant impact on the lives of its people. When historical challenges resulted in our exit, our re-entry into the market wasn’t only a showcase of our resilience and perseverance but our continued commitment to investing in the country, through project expertise, technology transfer, skills training and supply-chain development. This has been made possible through some of our infrastructure projects and successful public-private-partnerships. Our main goal is to assist countries meet their energy and economic developmental goals, given their local needs. According to the National Development Plan, energy infrastructure is a critical component that underpins economic activity and growth across South Africa. The role we can play in this is to invest in the right technologies, develop the right technical skills needed to help the industries grow and support local suppliers. Over the past three years, we have been able to increase our spend to support small black-owned businesses, with a specific focus on Qualifying Small Enterprises and Exempted Micro-Enterprises (new small enterprises), businesses owned by people with disabilities and youth. As an industry leader in cleaner power generation, we work collaboratively with our customers, helping them improve access to reliable and affordable power by harnessing local energy resources, and implementing innovative power generation technologies to reduce environmental impact. In South Africa, we are responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and quality of turbine islands and air-cooled condensers at the Kusile and Medupi power stations. In addition, GE Steam Power is constructing the first-of-its-kind environmental control technology system in Africa. The wet flue gas desulphurization plant at the Kusile site helps ensure that emissions released from the thermal power generation process are kept below the limits specified by environmental regulations. Outside of South Africa, we have been working closely with the Zimbabwe Power Corporation over the past decade to provide reliable energy in support of the country’s growing electricity demand. We are also active in various projects that vary in size and scope in Tanzania, Botswana, Cote d’Ivoire and Kenya. These projects will not only close the infrastructure gap but also bring much-needed power, improve energy security and availability and provide a catalyst for economic development. GE Steam Power is proud to be part of GE’s group of companies encompassing healthcare, aviation and energy. GE generates nearly one-third of the world’s power — more than 1 600GW of electricity — in 140 countries, and helps equip 90% of the power transmission utilities worldwide. Our developmental approach is aligned with three United Nations sustainable development goals: Good Health and Wellbeing; Quality Education and Decent Work; and Economic Growth. We believe that access to affordable, reliable, sustainable electricity is critical to reducing poverty and hunger as well as promoting access to education and healthcare. And, as a company that has paved the way in innovation for more than a century, GE can deliver technology that helps achieve long-term sustainable development to meet the world ‘s emissions reduction targets as defined by the 2015 Paris Agreement. We recognise that to make a sustainable impact, we must be deliberate in our efforts to support social change. Over the years, we have leveraged large infrastructure projects that have provided opportunities to create jobs and develop the critical skills needed to drive continuous growth in the energy sector. Today, however, there are fewer projects of this nature and scale due to budgetary pressures and financing, so we have to think a little differently around how we nurture talent. Opportunities across vertical streams include manufacturing and reskilling (where needed) for maintenance and the operations of power plants; these need to be among the considerations for the future. When it comes to “giving back”, the concept is often misinterpreted as only supporting charitable causes. Therefore we place emphasis on the notion of “creating shared value” by working to strengthen public–private partnerships. For us to make meaningful impact we must be socially aware, and such partnerships allow us to identify key social challenges within various communities that we can address. Research shows that a healthy and safe learning environment aids learning and enhances education outcomes. In the past seven years, GE Steam Power — working with local municipalities and communities — has supported schools in the Mpumalanga province through its school infrastructure upgrade project, launched in 2013. Through this initiative, 10 existing schools have been refurbished and upgraded and a new school has been built. The projects take the environment into consideration, implementing ecologically conscious solutions such as rainwater harvesting, energy efficiency fittings, Enviro Loo water-free toilets, and low-maintenance landscaping. This work has enabled a better and more productive learning and teaching environment. Each project is implemented to benefit the community by providing employment and contracting opportunities that are co-ordinated in a fair and transparent way to help ensure project stability. GE has rolled out four school infrastructure projects in 2019 in and around the Mpumalanga province. In addition to infrastructure and building upgrades, landscaping and recreational areas also will be included in some projects.
