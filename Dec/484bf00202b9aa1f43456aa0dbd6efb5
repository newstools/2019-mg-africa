By grade four I was wearing two bras because my breasts were too big. By the time I got to university, it had become unbearable. I was wearing a 34-G cup and could not play sport because running was too painful and no one was making sports bras that could fit me.
I think the worst part was how my self-esteem was constantly low, with men making lewd comments and undressing me with their eyes when I walked past them. I really didn’t want the attention. I felt I needed to do something about it. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>So I started consulting doctors. Some did not want to do it, saying I was too young and what if my future boyfriends did not like the scarring of my breasts. No one asked me what I wanted and needed. Finally I found a doctor who agreed and luckily I was on medical aid that partially pays for breast reduction when there is a medical need. These breasts were affecting my physical body; my lower back was constantly in pain. But I did not have the R10 000 that I would have still needed. I tried working part-time jobs while studying but could never raise enough money. Then I moved to Jo’burg and was told about free surgery at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. The procedure could be done for free but I had to lose weight first and be on the right side of the BMI [body mass index] scale. I lost about 11kgs but the back pain was unbearable. So I decided I needed to focus on myself, finish my degree, find a job and save up to get the breast reduction. This year I got a job as an intern and though it’s not paying enough, I have been able to save to cover the co-payment on the medical aid. On November 28, I got the operation done. You have no idea how happy and excited I am about life now. People must be ready because I am going to embrace my body with all the scars that come with it. Now I can advocate for body positivity and enjoying the healthy body you have. — Nompilo Ntathu Zungu (24) as told to Athandiwe Saba
